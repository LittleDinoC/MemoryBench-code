Michael: All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Jim: Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
Michael: So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
Jim: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
Michael: All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #2]

Michael:  Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So that's the way it's done.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #3]

Michael: I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
Pam: Well. I don't know.
Michael: If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. 
Pam: What?
Michael: Any messages?
Pam: Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
Michael: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
Pam: You haven't told me.
Michael: It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #4]

Michael: People say I am the best boss. They go, 'God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.' 'And you get the best out of us.'  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #5]

Michael: Whassup!
Jim: Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Michael: Whassup!
Dwight: Whassup!
Michael: Whass...up!
Dwight: Whassup.
Michael:  What?
Jim: Nothing.
Michael: OK. All right. See you later.
Jim: All right. Take care.
Michael: Back to work.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #6]

Michael: Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #7]

Jan: Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Michael: Um... Me no get an agenda.
Jan: What? I'm sorry?
Michael: I didn't get any agenda.
Jan: Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
Michael: Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning?
Pam: Uh, yeah, the one...
Michael: Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Pam: You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Michael: Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
Jan: Do you want to look at mine?
Michael: Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
Jan: OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
Michael: OK...
Jan: Michael, don't panic.
Michael: No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
Jan: No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
Michael: All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
Jan: I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
Michael: OK. No problem.
Jan: This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Michael: Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #8]

Michael: Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
Jan: Go ahead.
Michael: Packman.
Todd Packer: Hey, you big queen.
Michael: Oh, that's not appropriate.
Todd Packer: Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
Michael: Uh, I don't know what you mean.
Todd Packer: I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Michael: Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
Jan: So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
Michael: No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #9]

Michael: Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #10]

Michael: Hey.
Ryan: Hey.
Pam: This is Mr. Scott.
Michael: Guilty! Guilty as charged!
Ryan: Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Michael: Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
Ryan: Yup.
Michael: Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. 


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #11]

Pam: You just still have these messages from yesterday.
Michael: Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. 
Pam: What?
Michael: Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
Pam: Don't we all?
Michael: I'm sorry?
Pam: Nothing.
Michael: If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. 


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #12]

Michael: I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #13]

Michael: People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #14]

Michael: Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
Dwight: I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
Michael: I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
Oscar: Can't you just tell us.
Dwight: Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
Michael: You don't know what it is. 
Dwight: OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Michael: I don't need your permission.
Dwight: Go ahead.
Michael: Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #15]

Oscar: Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Michael: Not gonna happen.
Stanley: It could be out of your hands Michael.
Michael: It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
Stanley: Can you promise that?
Dwight: On his mother's grave.
Michael: No.
Phyllis: What?
Michael: Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
Stanley: It's just that we need to know.
Michael: I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
Pam: I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Man: Are you sure about that?
Michael: Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
Dwight: Pam, information is power.
Stanley: You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
Michael: No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #16]

Michael: Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
Ryan: What's up? Nice to meet you.
Michael: Introduce yourself. Be polite.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Michael: Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
Dwight: Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
Michael: That's his profit.
Dwight: New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #17]

Dwight: Damn it! Jim!
Michael: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
Dwight: He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
Pam: 
Dwight: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #18]

Michael: What is that?
Dwight: That is my stapler.
Michael: No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
Dwight: OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him?
Jim: How do you know it was me?
Dwight: It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Michael: Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
Jim: OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
Michael:  Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
Ryan: You should've put him in custardy.
Michael: Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
Dwight: OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
Michael: Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #19]

Michael: So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
Ryan: All right.
Michael: Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
Pam: You got a fax.
Michael: Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
Pam: What? Why?
Michael: Why? Well, theft and stealing.
Pam: Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Michael: Post-it Notes.
Pam: Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
Michael: 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Pam: Are you serious?
Michael: Yeah. I am.
Pam: I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
Michael: But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
Michael:  You been X'd punk!  Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
Pam: You're a jerk.
Michael: I don't know about that.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #20]

Michael: What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #21]

Dwight: Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
Michael:  Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.
Jim: My name is Jim Halpert and I am a sales rep, which is a very important job. Um, without me dozens literally dozens of small businesses would go paperless.  They would have to write on their hands, or bed sheets, or who knows you know. Total chaos, total chaos. I mean or they could get their paper somewhere else. Staples maybe. I don't know.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #22]

Michael: Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
Pam: I guess.
Michael: Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.
Pam: What?
Michael: Messages?


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #23]

Michael: Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five.  Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam.  Now, who was the one before Curly?
Ryan: Uh, Shemp.
Michael: Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.
Ryan: Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Michael: Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go.  I'm Hitler. Right.  Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. 


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #24]

Michael: All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster.  'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #25]

Michael: So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money.  This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient.  Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting.  'Very interesting, but stupid.' Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #26]

Michael: What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #27]

Michael: What's that?
Pam: Wired.
Michael: Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.
Pam: Oh, yeah.
Michael: Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating?
Pam: Smoked turkey.
Michael: Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #28]

Michael: Do I need to speak up?  Hello.


[Date: March 24, 2005, Session #29]

Michael: I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.

[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #30]

Michael: Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
Mr. Brown: Oh, I'm all set, thanks.
Michael: Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #31]

Michael: Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #32]

Michael: Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
Oscar: All right.
Michael: Did you have a good weekend going there?
Oscar: It was fine.
Michael: Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
Oscar: Martinez.
Michael: Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
Mr. Brown: Great. We're all set.
Michael: Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
Jim: Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
Michael: It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
Jim: You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #33]

Mr. Brown: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Michael: Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
Mr. Brown: Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
Michael: You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
Mr. Brown: Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
Michael: Exactly, were not...
Mr. Brown: That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
Michael: With tolerance.
Mr. Brown: No. With more ignorance.
Michael: Ignorance.
Mr. Brown: Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
Michael: Let's celebrate.
Mr. Brown: Right. OK.
Michael: Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
Mr. Brown: Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...
Michael: You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
Dwight: I have two. White and Indian.
Mr. Brown: Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Michael: Yes.
Mr. Brown: Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
Michael: OK.
Mr. Brown: Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
Dwight: A few of the ground rules?
Michael: Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
Dwight: OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Mr. Brown: Um...
Dwight: I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Mr. Brown: Well, we only have an hour.
Dwight: I figured it would save time.
Michael: OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
Mr. Brown: Mr. Brown.
Michael: Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
Mr. Brown: Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #34]

Michael: How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #35]

Mr. Brown: So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
Michael: I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Mr. Brown: Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
Michael: OK, I will play guy listening.
Mr. Brown: Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
Kevin: I remember.
Mr. Brown: Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
Michael: OK.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #36]

Michael: Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #37]

Kevin: Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
Michael: OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid!
Mr. Brown: Wait a second.
Michael:  They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
Mr. Brown: Stop it!
Michael:  What you want a cookie?


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #38]

Mr. Brown: Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Dwight: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Mr. Brown: Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
Dwight: A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
Mr. Brown: OK.
Dwight: A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Mr. Brown: Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
Dwight: We all have a hero in our heart.
Mr. Brown: Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
Michael:  I don't think I can sign this.
Mr. Brown: I can't leave until you do.
Michael: Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
Mr. Brown: Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
Michael: Sure.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #39]

Mr. Brown: We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
Michael: Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
Mr. Brown: Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
Michael: OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
Mr. Brown: Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
Michael: OK.
Mr. Brown: Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
Michael: Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
Mr. Brown: Don't worry about dating.
Michael: I won't.
Mr. Brown: OK. Thank you.
Michael: Yeah, yeah.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #40]

Michael: I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...' Open-mindedness, is that even a word? '...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.'  He's going to lose it when he reads that.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #41]

Jim: Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
Michael: I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.' I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #42]

Michael: All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
Toby: Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? 
Michael: Get out.
Toby: I'm sorry.
Michael: No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #43]

Michael:  Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #44]

Michael: OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
Jim: : Uh, is that it?
Michael: Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
Kevin: It was kind of hard to hear.
Michael: Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
Kelly: I have a customer meeting.
Michael: Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
Oscar: What part Native American?
Michael: Two fifteenths.
Oscar: Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Michael: Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Oscar: OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Michael: Oh, yeah...
Oscar: And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Michael: Wow.
Oscar: My parents were Mexican.
Michael: Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
Oscar: Thank... Yeah...
Michael: Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
Oscar: Mexican isn't offensive.
Michael: Well, it has certain connotations.
Oscar: Like what?
Michael: Like... I don't... I don't know.
Oscar: What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
Michael: No. Now, remember that honesty...
Oscar: I'm just curious.
Michael: ...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!
Jim: Hello? Hello?


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #45]

Michael: I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #46]

Michael: Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #47]

Michael: Oh this is a good one.
Pam: Um, hi. How are you?
Stanley: Fine. How are you?
Pam: Great.
Michael: Push it.
Stanley: I admire your culture's success in America.
Pam: Thank you.
Michael: Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
Stanley: Who am I supposed to be?
Michael: No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
Dwight: Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
Dwight: Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Pam: That's nice, Dwight.
Dwight: OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Pam: OK, I like your food.
Dwight: Outback steakhouse.  I'm Australian, mate!
Michael: Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
Pam: OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.
Dwight: Oh, man, am I a woman?


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #48]

Michael: You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. 'Too soon for Arabs.' Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #49]

Kevin: Hey.
Angela: Hey.
Kevin: You wanna go to the beach?
Angela: Sure.
Kevin: You wanna get high?
Angela: No.
Kevin: I think you do, mon.
Angela: Stop...
Michael: OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #50]

Michael:  Kelly, how are you?
Kelly: I just had the longest meeting.
Michael: Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my... 
Michael:  All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #51]

Michael: I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
Kevin: Maybe some spagh-etti.
Michael: Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
Stanley: It's collard greens.
Michael: What?
Stanley: It's collard greens.
Michael: That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #52]

Mr. Brown: Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Michael: Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
Mr. Brown: Does this company have 100 years to erase?
Michael: No, the country.
Mr. Brown: Oh right, more like 200 years.
Michael: Yeah, more like a 1,000.
Mr. Brown: Okay, um. Uh, I'll try to make this quick.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #53]

Mr. Brown: HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Michael: I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...
Mr. Brown: Oh, nice.
Michael: Expectations....
Mr. Brown: Good.
Michael: Thank you. Sharing...
Mr. Brown: Great.
Michael: And tolerance.
Mr. Brown: Beautiful.
Pam: Um, that spells incest.
Mr. Brown: Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Michael: Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.
Mr. Brown: Yeah, but it's not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
Michael: I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
Mr. Brown: Okay, Michael, I just...
Michael: No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #54]

Mr. Brown: Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Ryan: I have something.
Mr. Brown: Yes, please.
Ryan: Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
Michael: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
Mr. Brown: No, no, no, no. An outsider's perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
Michael: Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
Ryan: What do you want me to do?
Michael: Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.
Mr. Brown: I'm sorry, Michael. We're actually out of time.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #55]

Michael: In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.'  He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone!  I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed.  No doubt about it.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #56]

Michael: Are we going?   Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.
Dwight: Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
Michael:  Should I... turn, no. Do it again.
Dwight: Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Michael: Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Dwight: Take six.
Michael: Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Dwight: Action.
Michael: Don't. Please don't say anything.  Oh, God.
Dwight: And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
Michael: Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Dwight: Cut.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #57]

Michael:  I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #58]

Michael: Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #59]

Michael: Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. 


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #60]

Dwight:  Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Michael: Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
Pam: It didn't have anything to do with race.
Michael: Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.


[Date: March 29, 2005, Session #61]

Michael: Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my...  All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you.  She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time.  Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
Jim: Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Michael: What, huh?
Pam: What card was she?
Jim: I think she wasn't wearing a card.
Michael: It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.

[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #62]

Michael: Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
Pam: I'm not making any copies.
Michael: Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Pam: Nothing new.
Michael: Lay them on me. What?
Pam: There's nothing new.
Michael: That's not what you said earlier.
Pam: Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... 


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #63]

Michael: The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #64]

Jan: So, which health plan have you decided on?
Michael: I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Jan: Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Michael: I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
Jan: The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Michael: Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: You gotta crack these things open.
Jan: You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Michael: Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
Jan: It's your job. So...
Michael: Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
Jan: Michael... maybe... I mean...
Michael: There, there...
Jan: Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Michael:  When have you ever done that?
Jan: I'm doing it right now. To you.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #65]

Jim: Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Pam: No. I have a life.
Jim: Interesting, what's that like?
Pam: You should try it sometime.
Jim: Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Pam: ... your problem.
Michael: Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #66]

Michael: There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
Jim: Gosh.
Michael: Yeah!
Jim: That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #67]

Dwight: OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Michael: Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
Dwight: OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Michael: You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Dwight:  Yes, I have an office.  Bigger than his.
Michael: Nope, you cannot use it.
Dwight: OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Michael: Temporary workspace. You can use it.
Dwight: Thank you.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #68]

Michael: If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #69]

Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael:  Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
Pam: Where are you?
Michael: Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
Pam: Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
Michael: Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
Pam: No you're not.
Michael: I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Pam: OK.
Michael: Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Pam: Still no one calling.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #70]

Oscar: Michael, can I talk to you?
Michael: Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Meredith: Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael: Ah, what? Which memo?
Pam: Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Michael: Is it a good plan?
Dwight: It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Oscar: It's like a pay decrease.
Pam: Michael, he made huge cuts.
Michael: Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
Dwight: Yeah, you said...
Michael: No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
Dwight: I can handle that.
Michael: OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #71]

Michael: Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #72]

Michael: You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.

[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #73]

Michael: So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
Travel Agent: I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
Michael: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #74]

Michael:  Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Man on Phone: You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
Michael: Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Man on Phone: It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
Michael: So it's not a free fall?
Man on Phone: It's an industrial coal elevator.
Michael: Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #75]

Michael: OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #76]

Michael: Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!  Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
Ryan: Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Michael: Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
Stanley: Oh, thanks.
Michael: There you go.
Stanley: This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Michael: Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
Dwight: Michael. Michael?
Michael:  Oh, Christ.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #77]

Oscar: Well?
Michael: Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
Oscar: OK, the health care plan.
Pam: Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Michael: Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
Dwight: I most certainly did not.
Michael: Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
Angela: What about the surprise?
Michael: Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Stanley: We all think you don't have a surprise.
Michael: All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #78]

Michael: When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #79]

Michael:  God, yeah... Ah! This...


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #80]

Michael: Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #81]

Oscar: Michael I need to talk to you.
Michael: Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.
Oscar:  Michael.
Michael: Yeah, no... 
Oscar: Michael, Michael I...  ... inside.
Michael: You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #82]

Michael: Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it's big. It's probably one of the most popular in the state. So...
Man on Phone: Hello.
Michael:  Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here.  Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
Man on Phone: Oh, I think we already did our order this month.
Michael: No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
Man on Phone: You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
Michael: Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Man on Phone: Well, it goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
Michael: So it's not a free fall?
Man on Phone: It's an industrial coal elevator.
Michael: Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?
Man on Phone: No, you just look around. It's a historically preserved coal mine.
Michael: That's it?
Man on Phone: Well, there's the adjacent Anthracite Heritage Museum. They got some really interesting old mining tools. There's also a photo mural exhibit. Uh, bat guano sculpture. 
Michael: Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #83]

Michael: I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.  'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step  And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.


[Date: April 5, 2005, Session #84]

Dwight: Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Michael: We're all going bowling!

[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #85]

Dwight: Michael!?
Michael: Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
Dwight: I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
Michael: There's no downsizing.
Dwight: I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
Michael: Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Dwight: Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
Michael: Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
Michael: But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
Dwight: Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Michael: Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #86]

Michael: It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.'  'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way.  'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #87]

Michael: Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
Michael: Who is it? Who's the birthday?
Pam: Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
Michael: Next person on the...
Pam: Oh.
Michael: ...calendar.
Pam: Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
Michael: Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Pam: But it's not until next month.
Michael: Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
Pam: You still want to have a party?
Michael: Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Michael:  Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #88]

Michael: These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
Michael: So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
Angela: Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
Michael: She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
Pam: It is... her birthday.
Michael: Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #89]

Michael:  Can you get her? She's right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.' 


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #90]

Michael:  Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
Michael: Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
Oscar: Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Michael: Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
Oscar: My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
Michael: What?
Oscar: Donate to the charity?
Michael: Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Oscar: Thank you.
Michael: No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
Oscar: That's... that's... that's very generous.
Michael: Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #91]

Michael:  Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Dwight: Hey, you wanted to see me?
Michael: Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
Dwight: I don't think she'd be missed.
Michael: There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Dwight: Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Michael: I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
Dwight: She had a hysterectomy.
Michael:  Which one is that again?
Dwight: That's where they remove the uterus.
Michael: Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Dwight: It could be kind of funny.
Michael: You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #92]

Ryan: Michael? Are you done yet?
Michael: Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #93]

Everybody: Surprise!
Meredith: Oh! Surprise.
Angela: No, it's ah...
Michael: It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
Everybody:  Happy birthday to you.
Michael: Find a key.
Everybody: Happy birthday...


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #94]

Everybody:  ... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you...
Michael: And many more!


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #95]

Stanley: Last year, five years ago...
Michael: You were surprised, weren't you?
Meredith: Yes.
Michael: You looked freaked, man. We said 'Surprise.' You were, like, 'What?' 'What the hell's goin' on here?' Good cake. Why don't you have some?
Meredith: Uh, I can't. Um...
Michael: Come on. A little bit.
Meredith: I can't eat dairy.
Michael: Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
Meredith: Yeah, it makes me sick.
Michael: You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #96]

Michael: Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Jim: Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Michael: Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
Jim: Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
Michael: Is Oscar around?


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #97]

Michael: I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
Oscar: Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
Michael: I know...
Oscar: It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
Michael: Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Oscar: I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
Michael: No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Oscar: Yeah.
Michael: How many miles did he do last year?
Oscar: Last year, he walked 18 miles.
Michael: Son of a bitch. That is impressive.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #98]

Pam: Happy Birthday. 
Michael: Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
Meredith: Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
Michael:  I don't know about that.
Meredith: That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
Michael:  Huh! Thanks, downer.
Meredith: This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Michael: Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
Meredith: No, I... I get it. It's funny.
Michael:  You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Meredith: You're right. You're right. Yes.
Michael: Divorce. Um... OK, 'Meredith is so old...'
Oscar: How old is she?
Michael: Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
Everybody: How old is she?
Michael: She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
Michael: That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
Oscar: Uh, nice party Michael.
Michael: This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
Angela: Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
Phyllis: Oh, boy... You...
Michael: OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
Oscar: Per mile.
Michael: Per mile, yes.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #99]

Michael: I want it to be like... 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what,  that was Michael Scott.'  'But it was anonymous, how do you know?' 'Because I'm him.'

Pam:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
Michael: All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?'  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
Pam: I wasn't really going for anything.
Michael: No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, 'Oh, oh-hum.' A beautiful sunset, 'No, I'll catch the next one.' Right? Unicorn walks into the office, 'Oh, do you have an appointment?'  Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.
Pam: Are you being serious?
Michael: Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Okay. 
Pam: No one's calling.
Michael: I know, somebody will. And we'll wait.
Pam: Sometimes there's a lot of time between the calls.
Michael: I know, I know, we will wait.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: We will wait for the call and you will smile.  Let me try something, just while we're waiting.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Tell me if I'm smiling or not.  Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
Pam: Yes.
Michael: Okay, let me try this one.  Hi Pam, how are you?
Pam: No.
Michael: I mean you can tell.
Pam: Yeah, I could tell.
Michael: I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too.
Pam: That was a good example.
Michael: Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.
Pam: Okay. 
Michael: Show time! It's show time!
Pam:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I'll transfer you.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #104]

Toby: It's just a birthday card.
Michael: I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now.  What are you doing? Oh come on, you're ruining it. Toby, come on.  Just, look at that. That's wrecked. Ass. Get some white out.

Dwight: Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Michael: I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.

Dwight: That's where they remove the uterus.
Michael: Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Dwight: It could be kind of funny.
Michael:  Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Dwight: Mmm-hmm.
Michael: Help me out here.
Dwight: Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?
Michael: No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
Dwight: If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? 
Michael: What?
Dwight: From the downsizing.
Michael: There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight.  Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.

Michael: Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.
Meredith: I hate that.
Michael: I know. Ugh, that is so annoying.  Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything?  Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #107]

Michael: Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
Oscar: I never suggested...
Michael: No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
Oscar: Michael, if I gave you...
Michael: No, hey  it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair.
Oscar: Thank you.
Michael: Thank you.
Oscar: Okay.


[Date: April 12, 2005, Session #108]

Meredith: Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Michael: Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
Meredith: No, I...I get it. It's funny.
Michael:  You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, Okay, here's a good one. Um...'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Meredith: You're right. You're right. Yes.
Michael: Divorce. Um... Okay, 'Meredith is so old...'
Oscar: How old is she?
Michael: If everybody... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
Everybody: How old is she?
Michael: She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
Michael:  What's the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's surgery was unnecessary.
Meredith: You're talking about my hysterectomy.
Michael: Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it.  We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
Pam:  I'm so sorry.  ... seriously, we're just...
Michael: Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don't comfort... don't comfort her, that's not... She doesn't need comforting. We're just joking around. I think she's... No that's very unprofessional. I think she's being very unprofessional over there.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #109]

Michael: : Hey, you ready?
Michael: All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent.
Dwight: Michael!


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #110]

Michael: Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #111]

Michael: Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Dwight: Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
Michael: No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
Dwight: Oh, please.
Michael:  When I let him come to my pick-up game...
Dwight: I apologized for that.
Michael:  I vouched for you.
Dwight: Michael, I...
Michael: I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Dwight: I can handle that.
Michael: Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
Dwight: And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Michael: Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Dwight:  Same thing.
Michael: No, it's not. It's lower, so...
Dwight: It's close.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #112]

Michael: All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.
Ryan: Fine, don't worry about that.
Michael: And here we have 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood.' Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
Lonny: What's up?
Michael: And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
Darryl: It's not my real name.
Michael: No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
Ryan: Darryl Rogers?
Darryl: Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
Michael:  And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
Ryan: Yeah, yeah.
Michael: You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job!  Rapport!


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #113]

Michael: So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
Darryl: We're loading at one.
Michael: Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
Darryl: No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.
Michael: Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. 
Darryl: All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
Michael: All right, see you at one.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #114]

Michael: Are we ready for the game?
Everybody:  Yeah.
Michael: I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Dwight: Gimli.
Michael: Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
Dwight: Just trying to be helpful.
Michael: Uh,  'I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.'
Jim: That's him.
Michael: OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
Stanley: I'm sorry?
Michael: Um, what do you play? Center?
Stanley: Why 'of course'?
Michael: Uh...
Stanley: What's that supposed to mean?
Michael: Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
Jim: Uh, I heard it.
Michael: Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
Phyllis: I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Michael:  Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
Ryan: But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
Michael: Yes.
Ryan: OK.
Michael: Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
Oscar: I can help out, if you need me.
Michael: I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
Kevin: I have a hoop in my driveway.
Michael: No.
Phyllis: I have a sports bra.
Michael: No, no, ridiculous.
Dwight: Michael, look. 
Michael: Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: Sorry Phyllis.
Dwight: Can I be team captain?
Michael: No, I'm team captain.
Dwight: Can I be team manager?
Michael: No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
Dwight: Assistant team manager?
Michael: No.
Dwight: OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Michael: Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
Jim: Oh my God.
Michael: Threat neutralized.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #115]

Michael:  Off the backboard!
Pam: Please don't throw garbage at me.
Michael: Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Pam: I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
Jim: I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
Michael: Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Pam: Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Michael: Oh, yeah right.
Phyllis: I'll do it.
Michael: Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #116]

Michael: Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Darryl: Just getting a tea bag.

[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #137]

Michael: The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.

Michael: Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. 
Roy: What? Iverson's not fat.
Michael: No, neither am I. We both look good.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #140]

Michael: Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer.

[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #142]

Michael:  I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #143]

Michael: You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops.  Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.


[Date: April 19, 2005, Session #144]

Michael: Birdie. He's not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is... if you knew jazz, you'd know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.

Jan: No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
Michael: I didn't mean me!


[Date: April 26, 2005, Session #148]

[Date: April 26, 2005, Session #150]

Michael: I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.


[Date: April 26, 2005, Session #151]

Michael: This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall.   used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.

Katy: I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Michael: Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
Katy: What?
Michael: It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
Katy: Regular coffee is fine.
Michael: Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb

Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?

Katy: I wouldn't think of it.


[Date: April 26, 2005, Session #157]

Michael: Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!

Michael: I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
Dwight: It's actually better this way.
Michael: No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
Dwight: Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
Michael: No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
Dwight: Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
Michael: But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
Dwight: What?
Michael: She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
Dwight: Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Michael: Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
Dwight: Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
Michael: No. I cannot promise you that.
Dwight: You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
Michael: Listen, Dwight.
Dwight: Do you love her?
Michael:  Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel.

Michael: Did we get any mail?
Pam: Yeah, I gave it to you.

Michael: No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
Ryan: Well, it's empty.
Michael: Not it's not, there's some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out.
Ryan: Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
Michael: That's over several months, Ryan.
Ryan:  Still.


[Date: April 26, 2005, Session #165]

Michael: I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face.  I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know.


[Date: April 26, 2005, Session #166]

Michael: Sure you don't want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
Katy: Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
Michael: See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
Jim: Goodnight, Michael.
Michael: Where you going?
Jim: I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
Michael: With us?
Katy: I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
Michael: Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
Jim: I got this. 
Michael: Alright, have fun.
Katy: Thanks.
Jim: I got it.
Michael: Don't drink and drive.
Michael: Take it easy.
Jim: Have a good night.
Michael: You too, have a good night.
Katy: You got that?
Jim: Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
Katy: Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Jim: Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
Katy: Why?
Jim: This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
Katy: It's a... it's a very nice car.
Jim: You're not going to freak out?


[Date: April 27, 2005, Session #167]

Michael: Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.


[Date: April 27, 2005, Session #168]

Dwight: This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric.  You sell a lot of these?
Katy: It's very popular, yeah.
Dwight: I knew it. Is it waterproof?
Katy: I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.
Dwight: Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Katy: No.
Dwight: Cause I could look it up real easily.
Katy: You're really into reptiles, huh?
Dwight: My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. 
Katy: Oh, um, it's okay.
Michael: Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.
Dwight: I was just showing her my belt.
Michael: Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses?
Dwight: I....
Michael: He wears glasses. Did you know that?
Dwight: Not all the time.
Michael: Well, now suddenly he can see.  Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye.  There you go steaming hot cup of joe.
Katy: Thank you.
Michael: Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. 
Katy: Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
Michael: Yeah, yeah he is the worst.


[Date: April 27, 2005, Session #169]

Michael: What's the um, saying, 'once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just... Not that that's my... that's what I'm trying to do, but I think it helps kind of melts the ice. Breaks the ice, melts... Breaks the ice and melts them. Melts their hearts.


[Date: April 27, 2005, Session #170]

Michael: Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?
Katy: We could do that ten years ago.
Michael: Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.
Toby: Hi.
Katy: Hi.
Toby: Hey, did you go to Bishop Ohara?
Katy: Yeah.
Toby: Yeah, me too.
Katy: Cool, what year where you there?
Toby: 89
Katy: Oh.
Michael:  Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise.  Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.
Toby: It's just a snack.
Michael: Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
Toby: No.
Michael: Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
Toby: Just the once.
Michael: Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
Katy: I'm gonna go back to my table.
Michael: Okay. I'll see you in a bit.  She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.


[Date: April 27, 2005, Session #171]

Michael: All right. That's looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.
Ryan: What kind do you like?
Michael: Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
Ryan: Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Michael: Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.
Ryan: Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
Michael: Mmm hmm. I like 'em.
Ryan: Do you like The Hives?
Michael: Yes. God. They're awesome.
Ryan: You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
Michael: Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.
Ryan: Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Michael: Cool, so maybe hook me up  with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
Ryan: Absolutely.
Michael: All right. This is gonna be good.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #172]

Dwight: Go. Get the door.
Michael: Here we are.
Dwight: Go. Push!
Michael: Oh god.
Dwight: Push!
Michael: No, no, turn it around.
Dwight: Really shove it.
Michael: You'll break it.
Dwight: Shove it through! Break it!
Michael: You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
Michael: All right.
Dwight: I got a splinter.
Michael: Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
Dwight: I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
Michael: On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
Dwight: One, two, three. 
Michael: Merry Christmas!


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #173]

Michael: Did it work?
Kevin:  Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Michael: A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
Kevin: But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Michael: Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #174]

Michael:   Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
Angela: Fifty.
Michael: Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #175]

Michael: It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #176]

Michael: I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
Pam: You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
Michael: Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #177]

Michael: No! No way! It... no.
Darryl: Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
Michael: You wanna be Santa?
Darryl: Yeah.
Michael: Have you ever seen Santa?
Darryl: Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Michael: Okay.
Darryl: Who cares?
Michael: Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
Dwight: Michael, I would like to be the elf.
Michael: That makes sense because he has elfish features.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #178]

Michael: You get something good this year?
Jim: I think I did a pretty good job.
Michael: Yeah? Who did you have?
Jim: Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
Michael: I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
Jim: Yeah?
Michael: I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Jim: Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Michael: Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
Jim: That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
Michael: It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #179]

Dwight: Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
Stanley: I know how to plug something in.
Dwight: I want to do it.
Michael: All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
All: Three, two, one. 
Michael: Not great.
Phyllis: I'm sorry, everybody.
Pam: I think the tree looks nice.
Dwight: Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Michael: No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #180]

Michael: Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #181]

Dwight: Pam.
Pam:  Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
Jim: There's a little more to it.
Dwight: All right, next. Ryan. 
Michael: No, don't!
Ryan:  Whoa, a video iPod.
Michael: Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Ryan: Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Michael: You don't know that.
Ryan: Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Michael: I did?
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
Phyllis: I knitted it for you.
Michael: An oven mitt? Okay. 


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #182]

Michael: So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #183]

Kevin: Should we just keep opening up the presents?
Dwight: We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
Michael: I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
Jim: What is Yankee Swap?
Michael: One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
Jim: I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
Pam: Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
Michael: Well, I call it fun!
Oscar: Why are we doing this?
Michael: Because it's better. Because it's more special.
Angela: It sounds mean.
Michael: Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #184]

Michael: Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.
Meredith: I'll take the teapot.
Jim: Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Michael: Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
Pam: I'll take the iPod.
Ryan: And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
Dwight: Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Stanley:  That was meant for Kelly.
Ryan: Yeah, I figured.
Michael: I think this is going great.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #185]

Michael: Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #186]

Michael: Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
Oscar: I'll take the ... teapot.
Meredith: Damn it.
Dwight: Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
Meredith: I really want the iPod.
Dwight: It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Michael:  I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
Meredith: I'll take the oven mitt.
Michael: Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #187]

Michael: Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #188]

Michael:  'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'
Dwight: You and me, Michael. Yes!
Michael: Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
Dwight: I never said it was better than an iPod.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #189]

Michael: Last gift. Kevin.
Kevin: I want the foot bath.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #190]

Michael:  What is she so upset about?
Pam: Maybe because you hated her present so much.
Michael: Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Jim: Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
Stanley: And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
Michael: Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
Oscar: You got a bonus check?
Pam: How much?
Michael: It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
Stanley: All right, I'm done now.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #191]

Michael: Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #192]

Liquor Store Clerk: It comes to $166.41.
Michael: All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Liquor Store Clerk: Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.
Michael: Cool, cool. Box it up.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #193]

Michael: Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
Angela: What is that?
Michael: This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
Meredith: We can drink?
Toby: We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.
Michael: Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
Meredith: Me. Please.
Michael: Go, here we go!


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #194]

Michael: Anybody making out in here?  Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.  Okay, how's it going in here? 
Ryan: We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Angela: There should be some ..
Michael: No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #195]

Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Kevin: One, two, three. 
Michael: Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
Ryan: Oh, no.
Michael: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ryan: I really did not do anything.
Michael: Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #196]

Dwight: This is so awesome.
Michael: Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
Dwight: Thank you.
Michael: You're welcome.
Todd Packer:  Merry Christmas, asswipe!
Michael: No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
Todd Packer:  What's up my nerds. Check it out. 
Michael: Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
Todd Packer: Pacman need a drinky.
Michael: Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #197]

Michael: Darryl. There you go.  You earned it.
Darryl: That's okay, Mike.
Michael: No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
Darryl: All right. Thanks, man.
Michael: Hey, Merry Christmas.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #198]

Michael:  Lampshade on head! It's happening!


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #199]

Kevin: Thanks for the party, Michael.
Meredith: Yeah.
Bob Vance: Oh, hey. Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in?
Oscar: I'm in.
Dwight: Yes.
Oscar: Michael? Poor Richard's?
Michael: Yeah, that sounds good.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #200]

Michael: Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #201]

Michael: Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?
Meredith: Yep.
Michael: Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
Meredith: Yeah.
Michael: Okay!


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #202]

Michael: Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #203]

Michael: Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #204]

Michael: Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #205]

Oscar: Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
Michael: Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
Oscar: I'll take the tea pot.
Meredith: Damn it.
Kelly: So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.
Oscar: No, I just like tea.


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #206]

Michael: Oscar, paint ball pellets.
Oscar: I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
Pam: It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.
Meredith: Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
Michael: Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. 


[Date: December 23, 2005, Session #207]

Michael: See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.

[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #208]

Michael: Hello, everyone.
Dwight: Good morning, Michael.
Phyllis: Where are we going this afternoon?
Michael: Ah! Ha ha ha!


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #209]

Michael: Yeah?
Stanley: Michael.
Michael: Stanley! Bo banley.
Stanley: I need to know...
Michael: Banana fana fo fanley.
Stanley: What we're doing.
Michael: Be my mo manley.
Stanley: You said bring a toothbrush.
Michael: Stanley.
Stanley: Is this an overnight?
Michael: Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
Stanley: Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
Michael: Maybe, I don't know.
Stanley: Not maybe. Yes or no.
Michael: Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
Stanley: In January?
Michael: It's cheaper.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #210]

Michael: This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #211]

Michael: It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
Meredith: All right!
Ryan: I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
Michael: No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
Ryan: I'm already in business school.
Michael: Well, this...
Kelly: Wait, Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Kelly: Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
Michael: To throw you off the scent.
Kelly: Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
Michael: Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
Kelly: I took the tags off already.
Michael: Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #212]

Michael: I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #213]

Michael: Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #214]

Michael: Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
Darryl: How about the sales department is the sails?
Michael: Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
Phyllis: A furnace?
Jim: Yeesh, how old is this ship?
Pam: How about the anchor?
Phyllis: What does the furnace do?
Michael: All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
Jim: I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Michael: Titanic?
Pam: I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
Michael: No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #215]

Phyllis: Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
Michael: No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
Darryl: What?
Michael: The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
Dwight: Aye aye, Captain.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #216]

Michael:  A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #217]

Michael: Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.  Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring...  We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
Dwight: Cool.
Captain Jack: Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
Michael: I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
Captain Jack: I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship.  Hi, welcome aboard.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #218]

Michael: In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #219]

Michael: Hey, look! I'm king of the world!


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #220]

Captain Jack: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.
Michael: And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
Captain Jack: Okay! So...
Michael: Okay! So...
Captain Jack: Please. The life preservers.
Michael: Right.
Captain Jack: They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.
Michael: But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
Captain Jack: Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side.  Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...
Michael: I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
Captain Jack: Okay, Michael, if you don't mind...
Michael: Rock it!
Captain Jack: Please, okay?
Michael: If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!
Captain Jack: Michael.
Michael: Yep.
Captain Jack: Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?
Michael: We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
Captain Jack: Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
Michael: Hm? Okay. Yep.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #221]

Michael: Having fun?
Brenda: Yeah. Everybody's really nice.
Michael: Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
Brenda: When are you going to start the presentation?
Michael: Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
Captain Jack: Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!
Michael: So, okay.
Dwight: Limbo, whoo!
Captain Jack: All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
Meredith: Me.
Captain Jack: Okay...
Dwight: Me! Me, me, me.
Captain Jack: Uh... usually it's a woman.
Dwight: I'm stronger.
Captain Jack: Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #222]

Captain Jack: All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!
Michael: But before that, I have to do my presentation.
Captain Jack: Nope! Dance contest!
Michael: All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #223]

Michael: Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #224]

Captain Jack: So, what's this presentation all about?
Michael: Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
Captain Jack: Women and children.
Michael: No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
Captain Jack: That's a stupid analogy.
Michael: Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
Captain Jack: Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
Dwight: Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #225]

Captain Jack: Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?
Jim: Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
Michael: Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
Captain Jack: He's just sucking up!
Roy: When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
Captain Jack: Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #226]

Michael: I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
Roy: No, it was Captain Jack.
Michael: Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
Captain Jack: We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!
Michael: Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
Pam: No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
Michael: Then I'll give you away!
Pam: No, thank you.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #227]

Dwight: Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Michael: Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
Brenda: Really? What?
Michael: Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
Captain Jack: Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Michael: It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #228]

Michael: I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #229]

Michael: Is somebody there?
Jim: What happened to you?
Michael: Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
Jim: Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
Michael: He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
Jim: What a night.
Michael: Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
Jim: She was always engaged.
Michael: Roy said the first one didn't count.
Jim: That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
Michael: Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
Jim: Yeah, I know.
Michael: Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
Jim: Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
Michael: Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
Jim: She's engaged.
Michael: BFD. Engaged ain't married.
Jim: Huh.
Michael: Never, ever, ever give up.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #230]

Dwight: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
Michael: It's a fake wheel, dummy.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #231]

Michael:  Yeah.
Jan: Hello, Michael.
Michael: Hello.
Jan: Can we come in?
Michael: Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jan: Thank you very much.
Michael: Have a seat.
Jan: Brenda.
Michael: Oh, every man's dream.
Jan: Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?
Michael: Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...
Jan: A booze cruise? What do you mean?
Michael: Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...
Jan: Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.
Michael: Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.
Jan: Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.
Michael: Of course.
Jan: We discussed that.
Michael: Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
Jan: Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.
Michael: Hello.
Jan: I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.
Michael: Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Brenda: Jan said if you asked me that I was supposed to say no.
Michael: Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Brenda: Sure...
Jan: Brenda.
Michael: Thanks.
Brenda: I mean, no.
Jan: Okay, you know, I'm gonna go now, and...
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jan: Good luck, Brenda.
Michael: I'll see you later.
Jan: Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.
Michael: I'll call you later.
Jan: No, that's all right.
Michael: That's like...
Jan: You call me if you need anything, Brenda.
Michael: I'll call you, too.  So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #232]

Michael: What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?
Oscar: I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
Michael: I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...
Dwight: Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
Michael: No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.
Pam: How about the anchor?
Michael: Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well...  Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.
Brenda: Yeah, I know Toby from Jan's birthday.
Toby: Hey, Brenda.
Michael: Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #233]

Michael:  Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.
Toby: I got lost.
Michael: Idiot.
Captain Jack: We can go back.
Michael: No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!
Toby: I guess I shouldn't have stopped for dinner.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #234]

Dwight: Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
Captain Jack: Perch, bass.
Dwight: You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
Captain Jack: I haven't heard that, Dwight.
Dwight: If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
Captain Jack: That's good to know, Dwight. Thanks.
Michael: Your problem now, Captain Jack.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #235]

Michael: Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?
Ryan: At home, not on a boat?
Michael: Flash cards.
Ryan: Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Michael: You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
Ryan: Well...


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #236]

Captain Jack: Yeah! All right. All right. That was awesome. All right, looks like the guitar player's gonna take a little break. So this'd be a great time to head on over to the taco bar. All right.
Michael: That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay?  Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb.  Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead.  Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?
Creed: Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
Michael: You know what? I don't think it's in...
Creed: I...
Michael: That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...
Creed: I don't know, let's try.
Michael: ...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Creed: All right.
Michael: Good luck.
Creed: Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? 
Roy: Yeah!


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #237]

Michael: Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #238]

Katy: You should make a toast.
Jim: No, I really don't want to.
Katy: Jim, come on, don't be shy.
Katy: Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
Michael: Yeah! Toast!
Katy: Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!
Pam: Yeah.
Roy: Come on.
Jim: Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
Dwight: Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
Michael: That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... 
Katy: Cheers.


[Date: January 5, 2006, Session #239]

Michael: Hey, Jim. You got a hat?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Thanks.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #240]

Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael: Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
Pam: Michael, what's wrong?
Michael: I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
Pam: Ok, wait wait wait wait...
Michael: Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
Pam: Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
Michael: No, I want you to pick me up.
Jim: What?
Pam: Ok...
Jim: What's going on?
Pam: Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
Michael: I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
Jim: I'm sorry? Pam.
Pam: 
Jim: What is going on?
Michael: I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. 
Michael: OH GOD!
Jim: Hey, whoa, Michael...
Michael: Oh God!
Jim: It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
Michael: OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
Jim: You burned


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #241]

Michael: I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it's good for me.  It's the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it.  I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #242]

Michael: Pam, could you come get me?!
Pam: Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
Michael: Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
Phyllis: Michael, you should stay home and rest.
Michael: There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?
Kevin: Can you hop?
Michael: I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
Michael:  No one wants to pick me up!?
Dwight:  What is going on? What is going on?
Pam: Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
Michael: I'm not sick! I'm burned!
Dwight: I'm coming Michael!
Jim: Oh...
Dwight: I'm gonna save you!
Michael: Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
Dwight: Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Michael: I don't want Dwight!
Pam: Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?
Michael: I don't have a girlfriend.
Jim: But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
Michael: It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
Jim:  What was that...
Pam: What was that?! 
Jim: Oh!
Pam: Ohhhhhh!
Jim: He hit the pole!
Jim: It's broken right, he can't...
Pam: Oh my gosh.
Jim: Oh Dwight, Dwight,   Ohhhhhh!
Jim and Pam: Oh my God!
Pam: Is he ok?
Jim: He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Michael: Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #243]

Michael: Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.
Pam: You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
Michael: Did you explain why?
Pam: No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
Michael: Burned my foot, Pam.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #244]

Michael: Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.
Jim: So, where are you shipping your foot?
Michael: Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
Dwight: Your foot?


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #245]

Michael: Thank you.  Pam, messages please?
Pam: You didn't have any.
Michael: Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
Pam: And do my job?
Michael: No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
Dwight:   It slipped.
Michael: What?
Dwight: Sorry.
Pam: It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
Michael: I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask.
Pam: Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
Michael: No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
Dwight: Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
Michael: What?  Part of your duties are to what?
Dwight: What?
Michael: You just said 'part of your duties are to' something.
Dwight: No, I didn't.
Michael: Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
Dwight: What is wrong with


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #246]

Michael: Where is my cornbread?
Ryan: Here you go.
Michael: Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
Ryan: Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
Michael: Where are the yams?
Ryan: They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
Michael: Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
Ryan: Yes.
Michael: And they had no yams?
Ryan: They had no yams.
Michael: How strange.  Because they always have yams.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #247]

Michael: Pam... PAAAM!?
Pam: Oh, God.
Pam:  What.
Michael: Come here please.
Pam: Tell me before I come there.
Michael: I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Pam: No.
Michael: Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
Pam: No.
Michael: Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #248]

Michael: No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #249]

Toby: Wow, you just dive right into it.
Ryan: You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
Michael:  No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
Toby: What, what happened?
Michael: I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
Toby: What do you need?
Michael: Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
Toby: I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
Michael: Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
Toby: Ryan, is, uh, dead.
Michael: No, he's not.
Toby: Dead.
Michael: I just saw him.
Toby: No.  Can't, can't you just get up yourself?  I... You only grilled your foot.
Michael: Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #250]

Jim: Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
Pam: No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
Jim: And that isn't weird?
Pam: Wow...
Michael: Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?
Phyllis: Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
Michael: No, never heard of it.  No, a
Creed: When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
Michael: Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
Stanley: I'm not disabled and neither are you.
Michael: Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!
Stanley: Mailboxes, Etc.
Michael: Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
Phyllis: Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder.
Michael:  I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
Dwight:  Dad?


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #251]

Michael: While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
Jim: Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
Ryan: Twice.
Michael: Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia : AIDS.
Kevin: I think that's from Big.
Michael: I don't think so, no.
Kelly: Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
Michael: He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
Stanley: Uh hmmmm... .
Michael: What you mean uh hmmm... ?
Stanley: I mean I'm learning nothing.
Michael: Ok.
Billy Merchant: Michael Scott, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
Michael: Yes, right in here, come on in.
Billy Merchant: Great.
Michael: This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
Billy Merchant: Sorry I'm late.  Someone parked in the handicapped parking space.
Billy Merchant: Hey everyone, I'm Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I'm the properties manager of this office park
Michael: You are so brave. You are so brave.
Billy Merchant: Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time...
Michael: But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
Billy Merchant: No, I just have a lot of properties to manage.
Michael: Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
Billy Merchant: I don't know, like 30 seconds?
Michael: Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
Michael: How did you get in your wheelchair?
Billy Merchant: This morning?  Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. 
Michael: Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
Billy Merchant: Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here.
Michael: Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.
Billy Merchant: Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old.  I don't really notice it anymore.
Michael: Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #252]

Billy Merchant: So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of...
Michael: Ok...
Billy Merchant: First is parking.  You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on.  Does anybody have any questions?   Yes. Yeah? yes...
Pam: Dwight, you have your hand up.
Michael: Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
Billy Merchant: You know what Michael?
Michael: Yeah...
Billy Merchant: Let me stop you right there.
Michael: Ok.
Billy Merchant: And leave.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #253]

Michael: Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #254]

Michael:  Hey!
Ryan: I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
Michael: You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
Ryan: You are very welcome.
Michael: Did you get the yams?
Ryan: No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
Michael:  Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
Ryan: You sure?
Michael: Yeh.
Ryan: Ok.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #255]

Michael: You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #256]

Michael: Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better.  My body's literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #257]

Michael: Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
Dwight:   Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Jim: Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
Michael: Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
Angela: He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.
Michael: Why don't you go with him?
Angela: I, barely know him...
Dwight: I want Michael to take me...
Michael: I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
Meredith: You can take my van!
Michael: Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive.
Jim: Fine.
Michael: We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
Jim: Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
Dwight: Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
Jim: What are you doing?  What, stop...
Dwight: Vietnam sounds.
Jim:  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Dwight: Tired... 
Jim: You can't lay down.
Dwight: Want to take a rake... .
Jim: Wake up. 
Dwight: Ahh!
Pam: Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
Jim: I'm just gonna get...
Dwight: Ok, Pam, thanks.
Pam: Get up, get up.
Dwight: You're the best.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Just keep him awake.
Dwight: It smells like chicken soup.
Pam: I know.
Dwight: I have to go to the hospital.
Pam: I know.
Dwight: Where we going?
Pam: I just want to say goodbye ok?
Dwight: I'll be back, I mean...
Pam: Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
Dwight: Why?
Pam: It's just hard to explain.
Dwight: Aw, Pam, you're adorable 
Pam: Oh my goodness!
Dwight: 
Pam: Come here.
Dwight: Oh, huggy hugs.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #258]

Michael: Shotgun!
Jim: You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #259]

Michael: The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #260]

Michael: Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?
Jim: Well, I think she has a kid.
Michael: Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
Dwight: Where are we going?
Jim: Come on, get inside.
Dwight: Where are we going?
Jim: We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
Michael: Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
Jim: We're going to the hospital, Michael.
Michael: I know, just sayin'.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #261]

Michael: Dwight, what are you drinking?
Dwight: I found it under the seat.
Jim: Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
Dwight: I'm thirsty.
Jim: Give the bottle to Michael 
Dwight: No!
Jim: Give the bottle to Michael!
Dwight: I'm thirsty!
Michael: Give it to me.
Dwight: No.
Michael: Dwight...  You just keep your eyes on the road.   Give me the bottle or you're fired.
Dwight: You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
Michael: Give it to me Dwight.
Dwight: No. 
Michael: Give me the bottle!!
Jim:  Will you stop?
Michael: Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
Jim: Michael stop.

Dwight: My eyes!


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #262]

Michael: Dwight, what is your middle name.
Dwight: Danger.
Michael:  Something with a 'K'.
Jim: It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
Michael: What do I write under 'reason for visit'?
Jim: Concussion.  What did you write?
Michael: Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.
Jim: So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Michael: No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. 
Jim: Come on Dwight. 
Dwight: Hi Michael!
Michael: Hi Dwight.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #263]

Dwight: Ahhh.  Mweehaa
Michael: Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
Doctor: A head injury.
Michael: Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
Doctor:  So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.
Dwight: What is that?
Michael: Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
Doctor: Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.
Michael: Ok, what kinda machine is that?
Doctor: Does the skin look red and swollen?
Dwight: That's what she said.
Michael: That's my joke, damnit Dwight.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #264]

Lab Tech: Ok, no electronics past this point.  Camera, sound equipment...
Michael: It's ok, they're with me.
Lab Tech: No metal of any kind.
Michael: Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
Dwight: I don't want to do this.
Michael: Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out.
Dwight: Oh.
Michael: Fine. Fine.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #265]

Oscar:  You should put butter on it.
Michael: Uh, that's what she said.  See, haven't lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #266]

Michael: I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.   Want to try?


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #267]

Jim: You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.
Michael: Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs.
Jim: And doctors.
Michael: Yes, so, no thank you.
Dwight: Pssht.
Michael: What?
Dwight: Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
Michael: Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?   Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #268]

Toby:  Well you know, frankly a lot of us have been saying this for a long time.
Michael: Yeah, I've been sayin that.
Toby: Yeah, and I, uh, I think that the very fact that we're including it in our agenda frankly, is a big step forward.
Michael: Did you know I used to be in HR?
Toby: I'm sorry?
Michael: I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser.
Toby: Uh, ok.
Michael: Right? 
Toby: Uh, great.  Why don't we move on?
Michael: Alright. Movin' on.
Toby: Great.  Because you that I think the very fact that 
Michael: Ry-an.  You're here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where's Little Man Tate?
Ryan: They were out.
Michael: Oh come on.
Ryan: At three different places.
Michael: Oh man.  It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #269]

Michael: Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food.  You know how they say 'stuff a cold'?  Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #270]

Doctor: We need to get your friend into the CT machine.
Dwight: Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
Michael: No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
Dwight: Oh God.  Oh God.
Michael: Guh-od.
Dwight: Oh God.
Michael: Ok, I'll stand near you.
Dwight: Next to me?
Michael: Next-ish.


[Date: January 12, 2006, Session #271]

Jim: I'm gonna pull the car around.
Michael: Shh shh shh shh.
Jim: Do you speak Spanish?
Michael: No. Do you?
Jim: No, I don't.

[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #272]

Jim: Not much what's up with you?
Pam: Oh, I can not believe I fell for that.  Oh, my God.
Michael: Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.
Jim: Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Michael: What's up-dog?
Jim: Nothin' much what's up with you?
Michael: Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #273]

Michael: Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
Stanley: I'm on the phone.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #274]

Michael: Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?
Ryan: What's that?
Michael: I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
Ryan: Huh?
Michael:  No, damn it!


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #275]

Kevin: What does that mean?
Michael: What does what mean?
Kevin: The thing you just said?
Michael: Just forget it.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #276]

Michael: Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
Dwight: What's up-dog?
Michael: Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
Dwight: Good. How are you doing?
Jim:  So close.
Michael:  Damn it.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #277]

Michael: Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...
Dwight: Empty mind.
Michael: No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #278]

Dwight: Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Oscar is out sick.
Michael: On a Friday? 


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #279]

Dwight: Can I do some of the talking?
Michael: I will do all the talking.
Dwight: Ok, let him know that I'm here.
Oscar: Hello.
Michael: What difference does it make whether your here?
Oscar: Hello?
Michael: Hi, Oscar its Michael.
Dwight: And Dwight.
Michael: Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
Oscar: Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
Michael: Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
Oscar: Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
Dwight: Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
Michael: What are your symptoms?
Oscar: I have the chills.
Michael: Umm, hmmm.
Oscar: I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
Dwight: Checks out.
Oscar: Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
Michael: I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
Oscar: I'll just be sleep--- 
Dwight: Ok. First impressions?
Michael: He sounded sick.
Dwight: Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Michael: That's exactly what I was thinking.
Dwight: Question? May I investigate?
Michael: Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #280]

Pam: I bought my veil.
Kelly: Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
Pam: Ummm...
Kelly: Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
Pam: Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
Kelly: You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
Michael: Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #281]

Jim: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey Jim-bag.
Jim: Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Umm, hmm.
Michael: Who else knows?
Jim: Nobody.
Michael: Wow!


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #282]

Michael: Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #283]

Michael: My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles.
Jim: Alright. Great. Thank you.

Jim: I'm going to take off actually.
Michael: Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?
Stanley: Hmm?
Michael:  Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #285]

Michael: It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
Jim: Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Michael: Not so much.
Dwight: Ok, what is going on here?
Michael: Nothing.
Dwight: Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
Michael: Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
Dwight: Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
Jim: Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Dwight: Is that true?
Michael: Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
Dwight: Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Michael: Ok.
Dwight: I can tell. I won't let you down.
Michael: Good.
Jim: Thanks.
Michael: Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch?
Jim: I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Michael: Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
Jim: No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
Michael: Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
Jim: Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
Michael: I know just he place.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #286]

Michael:  Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #287]

Michael: Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #288]

Michael: Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.
Dana: Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.
Michael: We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
Jim: Nope we're not brothers.
Michael: I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
Jim: Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Dana: And for you?
Michael: Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
Dana: Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce.
Michael: Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. 
Dana: Is that what you really want?
Michael: No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
Dana: Great.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #289]

Michael: What do you like best about Pam?
Jim: Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Michael: Is it her boobs, or...
Jim: Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Uh-huh.
Michael: Never get's any of my jokes.
Jim: What about you?
Michael: Her boobs, definitely.
Jim: Wow, that's not what I meant.
Dana: Here you go.
Michael: Oh, thank you.
Dana: And I understand we have a birthday today.
Michael: Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
Dana: Ready girls? Front side.
Hooter's Girls: You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo!
Jim: Thank you.
Michael: Woo! Yeah!
Jim: Thanks, thanks Dana.
Michael: Thank you very much.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #290]

Michael: Hilarious. Hey.
Pam: What did you guys talk about?
Jim:  Just you know politics, literature.
Pam: I hate you.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #291]

Dwight: Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Michael: Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
Dwight: Including prep time?
Michael: Just do it.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #292]

Michael:  Expenses.
Kevin: Michael is that a wig?
Michael: No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
Kevin: No.
Angela: This is from Hooters.
Michael: Yeah, it's a business lunch.
Angela: Did Toby approve this?
Michael: No he did not. I don't need his permission.
Toby: You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #293]

Michael: Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #294]

Michael: I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
Toby: I'm not processing this.
Michael: Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
Toby: He seems fine to me.
Michael: You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
Kelly: Pam?


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #295]

Kevin: Jim has got it bad for Pam.
Creed: Oh ho!  Which one is Pam?
Kevin: Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
Michael: You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #296]

Jim: Hey.
Michael: I know, I know, I know.
Jim: Umm, what happened?
Michael: I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
Jim: Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Michael: Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
Jim: Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Michael: Yeah I'm good.
Jim: Good.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #297]

Pam: Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
Michael: Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
Pam: Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.
Michael: No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
Pam: No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
Michael: It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Pam: Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Michael: Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #298]

Michael: People are always coming to me. 'Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.' No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #299]

Michael: Hello. Pammy want a cracker?
Pam: No thanks. You got a package.
Michael: Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. 


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #300]

Dwight: And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
Michael: Oh!
Dwight: He totally misses,
Michael: No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do.
Dwight: Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
Michael: No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. 
Michael: All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.
Dwight: Jack Nicholas.
Michael: It's a celebrity tournament.
Dwight:  I got it. No problem. 
Michael: Do you see it?
Dwight: Oh, man, it's really back there.
Michael: Do you feel it?
Dwight: Yeah. I can barely...
Michael:  God... damn it, Dwight! That's great.
Dwight: Should I clean out my desk?
Michael:  That won't be necessary.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #301]

Michael: Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away.
Dwight: If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
Michael: No, I am the King bee,
Dwight: Queen's higher.
Michael: No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #302]

Ryan: People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
Michael: Keep. I will finish that later.
Ryan: It's from '99.
Michael: Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan.
Ryan: 18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #303]

Michael: Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt.


[Date: January 19, 2006, Session #304]

Michael: Thank you, Dana.
Dana: Sure.
Michael: Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.
Jim: Wow. Thanks.
Michael: You're welcome.
Jim: No, you what, seriously, you should have it.
Michael: No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical.
Jim: Oh, tomorrow, that's gonna be tough 'cause I already laid out my outfit, so...
Michael: Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.

[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #305]

Michael: Spamster!
Pam: Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
Michael: Hamster.
Pam: Right.
Michael: Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
Pam: It was great.
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: Mm-hm.
Michael: Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #306]

Michael: I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay.  Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
Pam: What?
Michael: Wow!  What happened in there?
Pam: I don't know.
Michael: There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
Pam:  Oh... I don't know.
Michael: Is it a bird?
Pam: No, I don't think it's a bird.
Michael: Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
Kevin: What's goin' on?
Michael: Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
Kevin:  I don't think that's vomit.
Michael: Check it out.
Kevin: Me?
Michael: Check it out.  Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
Kevin: Oh, that's ridiculous.
Michael: What is it?
Kevin: Michael. 
Michael: What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
Kevin:  Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
Pam: Open the door up!


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #307]

Pam and others:   Phew.  Oh!  No, mm-mm. 
Michael: I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
Toby: That's no burst pipe.
Michael: How do you know that?  What is it, then?
Creed: Hi guys.  Somebody makin' soup?


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #308]

Michael:  Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. 
Dwight:  It's still stinky.
Michael: That is worse.
Dwight: She probably scrubbed it


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #309]

Michael:   I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um...    I can't stand it , I can't stay in here another second.  No!


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #310]

Jim:  Oh.  Wow.
Pam: 
Michael:   Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
Jim: That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
Michael: Oh... It's ...
Jim: But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
Michael:  Yeah ...
Jim: ...which I guess I'll be taking.
Michael: No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
Jim: No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #311]

Michael:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
Dwight:  Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
Michael: Don't ape me.
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: This is great.
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: The pressures of my office are insane.
Dwight:  Mm.
Michael: I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
Dwight: No way!
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: And who had your office?


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #312]

Michael: Ed Truck.   Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.'  What a jerk.  He's... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #313]

Michael: You know who used to sit at that desk?
Dwight: That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Michael: Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
Dwight: No!
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: I thought he was out on the road.
Michael: He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
Dwight: Ah.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #314]

Michael: When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office .  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #315]

Michael: I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Stanley:  Excuse me one second, please.  What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
Michael: Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #316]

Michael: Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #317]

Creed:  What did you hit me for?
Michael: Charley horse!
Creed: What?
Michael: Charley horse!
Creed: You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
Michael: Oh, okay.  Gah.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #318]

Michael: Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.   It was hysterical.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #319]

Michael:  Dwight.
Dwight:  Michael.
Michael: Let's send up Accounting.
Dwight: What?
Michael: Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #320]

Michael: Hey guys.
Oscar: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Ahem.  What's up?
Oscar: Hey, Dwight.
Michael and Dwight:  Ahhhh!  Whoo hoo!  Come on, come on, come on, come on!  Sales rules!
Dwight: Yeah! 
Michael: Yeah! Oh ho ho 
Dwight: Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Michael: No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that.
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: Watch out, Pam. You're next!
Pam: You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
Michael: Maybe!


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #321]

Michael: Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don't know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #322]

Michael: You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #323]

Dwight:  Hello, am I the 107th caller?  Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller?  Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller?  I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Michael: Stop.
Dwight: Jethro Tull...
Michael: Stop it.  Stop.  It.   Don't.  Don't.
Dwight: I need to make a sales call.  Please?
Michael: All right.
Dwight:  Am I the 107th caller?


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #324]

Michael: Hi, guys.
Angela: We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
Michael: I'm just walking around.
Angela: Were you?
Michael: Well, yeah.
Oscar: It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
Michael: Oh, and I'm not?  Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun?  You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you?  I'm workin' for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael:  Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I'm going to ...  ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
Phyllis: You're gonna compete against us?
Michael: Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
Dwight: It is so on!
Michael: God, this is gonna be fun.
Dwight: Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #325]

Michael:  So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that!   Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  That's my sale! 
Darryl:  What... What's that?  Whatcha doing?
Michael:  Nothing.
Roy:  I think he's dancing.
Michael: No.  Just ...
Darryl: That was definitely not dancing.
Michael: You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
Darryl: Paper business.
Michael: Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
Roy: Nope.
Michael: Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. 


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #326]

Michael: This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #327]

Michael: You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
Pam: That doesn't seem fair.
Michael: You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
Dwight: But you're the one who picked today.
Michael: I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
Stanley: That's not what a hate crime is.
Michael: Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .   Very well.  Then you are all punished.
Pam: What's our punishment?
Michael: You're all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly.   No.  NO!  


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #328]

Michael: Do you remember Ed Truck?
Creed: Sure.  He hired me.  How's he doing?
Michael: How would I know?
Creed: I thought you might.
Michael: My biggest fear is turning into him.
Creed: Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
Michael:   I wasn't talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #329]

Michael:  Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin' back.
Ed: Yeah.  Should we go upstairs?
Michael: Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
Ed: So, what's the problem with my pension?
Michael: Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Ed: Well, what was done?
Michael: I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
Ed: Yeah, somebody once did that in my office.
Michael: Really?
Ed: Yeah.
Michael: Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
Ed: You can't expect to be friends with everybody.
Michael: Well... s-sure I can.
Ed: No.  They'll always think of you as a boss first.
Michael: Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
Ed: I'm not sure that ever happens.
Michael: Well, okay.  Different management styles.
Ed: Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #330]

Michael: Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, 'Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney.'


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #331]

Michael:  Yes.
Todd Packer: Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
Michael: Who is this?  How did you get this number?
Packer: Your mom, you gay nerd!
Michael: Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin'?
Todd: Hey, did you get that package I left for you?
Michael: Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
Packer: It was pretty big.
Michael: Really?
Packer: Yeah.
Michael: Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?
Packer: Left it in the middle of your office.
Michael: Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
Roy: You mean the thing?
Packer: 
Michael: Are you kidding me?  Oh!
Packer: Special delivery!
Michael: That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
Packer: Sit on the throne, Michael.
Michael: Oh.   Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #332]

Michael: It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don't expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun.  We just have fun!  Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #333]

Michael:  Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay.
Dwight:  Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
Stanley: ...cases of typical format and coated white paper. Okay, thanks again so much. All right, bye-bye.
Phyllis: 20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
Michael: What's going on? Anything here?
Stanley: Yes.
Michael: Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
Stanley: A sale.
Michael: Ah. Small?
Stanley: Big.
Michael: Huge?
Stanley: Just big.
Michael: Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or...
Stanley: Big.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #334]

Dwight:  Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Michael: What was that?
Dwight: What?
Michael: You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?
Dwight: You're the one who trained me, Michael.
Michael: Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
Dwight: You most certainly did not.
Michael: No, I did not.
Dwight: What can I do better?
Michael: Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
Dwight: I'm not good at jokes.
Michael: Do you know a joke?
Dwight: My cousin Mose told me a joke.
Michael: Call a client right now.
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: And tell him the joke.
Dwight: I will.
Michael: Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.
Dwight:  Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
Michael: Just sell it.
Dwight:  Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
Michael: Give me the phone.
Dwight:  I understand.
Michael: Give me the phone.
Dwight:  If I was offensive in any way, I...
Michael: Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
Dwight:  Humor works in...
Michael: The old one two. Let's do it.
Dwight:  ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second.  Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
Michael:  Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...
Dwight: That's not true.
Michael:  Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.
Dwight:  He's my best customer.
Michael:  What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
Dwight: But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
Michael:  Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.


[Date: January 26, 2006, Session #335]

Michael: I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.

[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #336]

Jan: Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
Michael:  Hey, what's going on?
Jan: Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
Michael: Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
Jan: What are you doing?
Michael: Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
Jan: Michael.
Michael: No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: They did this up in Albany...
Jan: You are not allowed in this session.
Michael: And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
Jan: Now you're really not allowed in this session.
Michael: Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...
Jan: I'm your boss.
Michael:  Anybody want any coffee or...
Jan: We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #337]

Michael: Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #338]

Michael: Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #339]

Michael:  Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #340]

Michael: Let's just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: That's what I'm talking about!
Jan: I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
Michael: Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
Jan: ... but it's very destructive.
Michael: Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Jan: Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
Michael: We have nowhere else Jan. This...
Dwight: We could do it in the warehouse.
Jan: Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
Michael: OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #341]

Michael: Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #342]

Michael: So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
Darryl: My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
Michael: You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
Roy: Why?
Michael: Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
Roy: I don't understand.
Michael: Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
Kevin:  I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
Jim: Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Kevin: I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #343]

Michael:  Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #344]

Darryl: Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
Michael: Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
Darryl: The experience...
Michael: Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #345]

Michael: Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are...  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #346]

Darryl: It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
Michael: Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
Darryl: Mike.
Michael: Stand clear.
Darryl: Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
Michael: I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Darryl: Look, would ya... look.
Michael: Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
Darryl: We're the ones that got to clean that up!
Lonny: Dammit, Michael!
Michael: We ought to have this thing serviced.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #347]

Michael: So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...
Madge: Hey, do you want me to go?
Michael: No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
Madge: I'll go.
Michael: Stay or...


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #348]

Michael: Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
Darryl: My priority is safety.
Michael: OK.
Darryl: So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
Michael: OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
Darryl: Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
Michael: I... That was just...
Darryl: That bothers me too.
Michael: I was breathing.
Roy: Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
Michael: I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
Lonny: You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?
Michael: OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #349]

Roy: I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like 'When are we going to go on a date-date?'
Guy: I hate that too! 
Darryl: I hate that too.
Kevin: That sucks so much.
Guy: It totally sucks.
Dwight: Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
Lonny: Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.
Michael: I feel you.
Darryl: No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
Dwight: Not literally.
Darryl: You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
Michael: Yes.
Darryl: We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
Michael: Ah, you do. So...
Darryl: But we get paid a lot less.
Dwight: Word.
Roy: Like next to no benefits.
Michael: I know. God! What is that?
Roy: Exactly.
Michael: It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
Darryl: You know this would not happen if we had a union.
Roy: That's what I'm talking about.
Michael: No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
Roy: Absolutely.
Darryl: That's what we need.
Guy: You know you're right.
Darryl: Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
Michael: You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
Darryl: It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
Roy: In my truck.
Michael: Dockworker's?
Darryl: Man, hook you up.
Men: 
Guy: Come on, man.
Michael: Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
Darryl: Union! Union, yeah.
Michael: The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Darryl: Are you with us Mike?
Michael: Yeah-es.
Darryl: Welcome to the warehouse.
Group chant: Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #350]

Jan: Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
Michael:  This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
Jan: What? A union! What...
Michael: Don't get hysterical.
Jan: I'm not...


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #351]

Michael: Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #352]

Michael: Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
Jan: The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
Michael: Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
Jan: You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
Michael: But we're bonding down there!
Jan: That's too bad.
Michael: I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
Jan: I don't want to...
Michael: Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
Jan: Michael! Michael! Michael!
Michael: We have a history...
Jan: Michael.
Michael: ...between us.
Jan: Don't say another word.
Michael: I won't
Jan: Get yourself down stairs.
Michael: I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #353]

Michael: Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #354]

Michael: Hi.
Jan: Did you take care of the situation?
Michael: Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
Jan: Excuse me.
Michael: I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
Jan: Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #355]

Michael: I'm just going to put this over there.
Darryl: This is not a good idea right here.
Michael: You did uh... okay.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #356]

Michael: Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #357]

Michael: Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
All the Men: Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.
Michael: Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #358]

Michael: Thank you to our hosts.
Darryl: Hey Michael. This ain't over.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #359]

Michael: Ahhh! Excellent.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #360]

Michael: Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #361]

Michael: Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.
Pam: You did?
Michael: And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Which one of these is coolest? What do you think?  
Pam: How about that one?
Michael: No, no. 
Jim: Oh, that one was good.
Michael: Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, 'I am so lame.' Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like...  You know what I'm talking about?
Jim: Do you mean vibrate?
Michael: Yes.


[Date: February 2, 2006, Session #362]

Roy: Bushmaster's hard to beat for long distance. It's a great point.
Dwight: Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Roy: Really?
Dwight: Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Michael: What are you guys talking about?
Dwight and Roy:  Guns.
Michael: Cool.
Roy: How's that union stuff coming?
Michael: Working on it.
Roy: Yeah.
Michael: Yup.
Roy: Okay.
Michael: All right.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #363]

Michael: Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Dwight: And you want me to come with you.
Michael: Nope. The opposite of that.
Dwight: I will stay here and run things on this end.
Michael: Ok, good.
Dwight: Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Michael: I probably will, why do you ask?
Dwight: Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: Screwed.
Michael: What


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #364]

Michael: This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #365]

Michael: Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Pam: That's OK.
Michael: Alright.
Oscar: The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Michael: Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #366]

Michael: Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #367]

Michael: The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. 


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #368]

Michael: Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #369]

Michael: Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to  Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #370]

Michael: This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #371]

Michael: I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #372]

Michael: There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
Craig: Hey.
Josh: Michael Scott. 
Michael: Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.
Josh: You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
Michael: Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. 
Craig: What's up buddy?
Michael: You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Craig: Guilty, yeah.
Michael: So what's going on? What I miss?
Josh: Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
Michael: Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... 


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #373]

Josh: What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
Craig: Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said 'You gotta fire four people,' and I was just like, 'What?' Ya know?
Josh: Did you?
Craig: No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.
Josh: She is our boss.
Craig: She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.
Michael: Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Craig: What? You like Jan? How can you
Michael: Maybe because she's my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
Josh: You hooked up with Jan?
Michael: You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
Josh: Yeah, let's change the subject.
Michael: Yeah, yeah.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #374]

Jan: Josh Porter, Stamford.
David: David 
Josh: Nice to meet you.
Jan: And Michael Scott, Scranton.
David: Nice to meet you.
Michael: Ditto.  How are you Jan?
Jan: Fine Michael. Thank you.
David: OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #375]

Josh: So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
David: Thanks very much.
Josh: Thank you.
David: OK, Michael.
Michael: What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. 
Michael:  Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #376]

Michael: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #377]

Michael:  And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. 
Michael: Questions?


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #378]

David: Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
Michael: Yes, thank you.
David: But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
Michael: Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... 


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #379]

Michael: Oh, ok. Alright.
Jan: NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
Michael: No you're not.
Jan: Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just  can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Michael: Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
Jan: Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
Michael: Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
Jan: Surely, you cannot be serious?
Michael: I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #380]

David: You understand this is a very serious situation.
Michael: No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. 
David: You made a joke?
Michael: I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. 
David: Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Michael: I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
Jan: Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
David: Good. 


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #381]

Jan: Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Michael: Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
Jan: Oh, no, it's OK.  So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Michael: Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. 
Jan: Oh.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #382]

Michael: Oy vey... schmear. 


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #383]

Michael: Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #384]

Michael: I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #385]

Michael: I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #386]

Michael: That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #387]

Michael: This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #388]

Receptionist: Yes, sure. Mr. Scott, you can head to the conference room. The other managers are already there.
Michael: Great. Thank you.
Receptionist: All right.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #389]

Michael: Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.


[Date: February 14, 2006, Session #390]

Devon: Hey Scott. Hey. Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! I want to talk to you. Come here!
Michael: You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.

[Date: March 2, 2006, Session #391]

Michael: Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
Dwight: They are either going to say yes... or no.
Michael: Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Dwight: Think it through.
Michael: Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
Jim: Can we not?
Michael: No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Jim: Still want that.
Michael: Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
Creed: Ryan!
Dwight: Fumble! Yaaah!
Michael: Hey, Dwight.
Dwight: Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Michael: You all right Ryan?
Dwight: Ryan.
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: Pam!


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #392]

Michael: That's what she said!
Dwight: Ha! I don't get it.
Michael: Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Dwight: Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Michael: Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #393]

Michael: Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #394]

Dwight: What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
Michael: That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #395]

Dwight: I can't do this.
Michael: That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
Dwight: Oh, okay.
Michael: But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
Dwight: Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Michael: Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
Dwight: I'll try and think of one. When...
Michael: Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
Dwight: Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Michael: Insult.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #396]

Michael:  But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Dwight: Saleswoman has a vagina.
Michael: It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.
Dwight: But I'm right?
Michael: Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
Dwight: Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Michael: I do. Both of them.
Dwight: Could I have a copy of one of them?
Michael: No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #397]

Michael: Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael:  Congratulations.
Phyllis: Unbelievable.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #398]

Michael: You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
Dwight: That is so great about the bonus!
Michael: No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #399]

Stanley: Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Phyllis: It's unbelievable!
Dwight: Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Pam: Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Dwight: Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Stanley: Why would this affect our bonuses?
Dwight: They are unrelated.
Kelly: Is Brad okay?
Dwight: He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
Oscar: What the hell is going on here?
Angela: Are we out of jobs?
Dwight: Yes.
Kelly: This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Michael: He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Stanley: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
Stanley: You said we were getting bonuses.
Michael: All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
Stanley: Cancel wallpaper.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #400]

Michael: As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Pam: You mean Toastmasters?
Michael: Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Pam: Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
Jim: Can I go?
Michael: Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Jim: So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Kevin: You should go to Hedonism.
Jim: What is that?
Kevin: It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
Jim: I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Toby: Been to Amsterdam.
Michael: Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Toby:  To Amsterdam.
Jim: When did you go there?
Toby: Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
Jim: Really for like how long?
Toby: Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
Creed: Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
Jim: Where do I want to go?
Creed: I'd send you to Hong Kong.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #401]

Michael: Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
Dwight: Good morning, Vietnam!  Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Jim: No. We're not.
Dwight: Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Which means absolutely nothing.
Dwight: Michael, can you explain?
Michael: Well, it's mostly made up. So...


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #402]

Michael: Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #403]

Michael: Confidence, Dwight.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #404]

Michael: It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
Angela: The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you, Angela.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #405]

Michael: All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #406]

Speaker: Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, Dwight Schrute!
Crowd: 
Michael: Dwight, they called your name.
Speaker: Dwight, how we doing?
Dwight: No, I can't... I ca...
Michael: All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you.  All right!
Crowd: 
Michael: Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #407]

Michael: I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #408]

Michael: Car starting.   All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Crowd: 
Michael: Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
Dwight:  Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.  how long we have been striving for greatness?  Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you  and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Crowd: 
Dwight: WE ARE WARRIORS!
Crowd: 
Dwight: Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Crowd: 
Dwight:  Yeah. Yes!


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #409]

Dwight: Ok, thanks.  There you are. What happened?
Michael: I got thirsty. How'd it go?
Dwight: It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
Michael: You would not believe what happened here.
Dwight: What? Something happened?
Michael: Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
Dwight: Weird.
Michael: Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
Dwight: Con artist.
Michael: She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #410]

Michael: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #411]

Dwight: And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
Michael: That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...
Dwight: Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Michael: That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
Dwight: It is?
Michael: It's your delivery...
Dwight: What is?
Michael: Our biggest worry.
Dwight: I don't follow.
Michael: My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you.  
Dwight: Oh, God!
Michael: See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #412]

Dwight: Well, that didn't go well.
Michael: No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #413]

Michael: All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
Dwight:  Stop it.  Two sailors walk into a bar...
Meredith: Please don't tell a sailor joke.
Dwight: Oh, why not?
Phyllis: Her nephew's in Iraq.
Michael: Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Pam: Yes, but they are both in danger.
Michael: Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #414]

Michael: Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.
Phyllis: What are we supposed to talk about?
Michael: Anything your heart desires.
Phyllis: I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Michael:  Louder!
Phyllis: I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Michael: Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
Ryan: Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Michael: Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.
Ryan: Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
Dwight: All right.
Stanley: Way to go, Ryan!
Michael: Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #415]

Michael: Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #416]

Michael: Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Dwight: Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Michael: Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #417]

Michael: Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
Dwight: Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
Michael: You're weird.
Dwight: No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Michael: Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.


[Date: March 3, 2006, Session #418]

Michael: Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car.  That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List.  Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.

[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #419]

Jim: Bribery. Nice.
Pam: Oh, I have more. 
Michael: Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Pam: Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today.  'Cause of the... 
Michael: ... Oh, God is that today?
Pam: I reminded you last night.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #420]

Michael: Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #421]

Michael: Well, I'll be in my office.
Pam: Don't you think you should say something?
Michael: They're cool.
Pam: Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
Michael: Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
Jim and Dwight:  That's Batman.
Michael: Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
Jim: The ocean.
Michael:  I work with a bunch of nerds.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #422]

Stanley: Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
Michael: Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
Melissa: I'm in eighth grade.
Michael: Oh.
Stanley: She's in middle school.
Michael: Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #423]

Michael: It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #424]

Michael:  They want how many spiral pads?
Meredith: Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #425]

Michael:  Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.  ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different.  Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #426]

Michael:  Yes. Well... we can...  uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright.  Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
Sasha: Sasha.
Michael: Nice to meet you.
Sasha: Ooh! 
Michael: Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor.  But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try?
Sasha: Sure. 
Michael: All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! 


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #427]

Dwight:  That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864.  The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Michael: Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight: There's a photo...
Michael: What the hell are you reading to them?
Dwight: These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
Michael: Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
Sasha: What's a Nazi?
Michael: What's a Nazi?
Dwight:  Nazi was a fascist movement...
Michael: Don't!
Dwight: ...from the 1930's...
Michael: Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
Dwight: I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Michael:  Why don't you just leave? Okay?
Dwight: ...Okay.
Jake: Bye, Mister Poop.
Michael: Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
The Kids:  I do, I do!


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #428]

Michael: Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. 


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #429]

Michael: This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
Melissa: So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
Michael: No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
Abby: That's not fair. 
Michael: Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
Jake: You're just a middleman.
Michael: I'm not just a middle... man...
Melissa: Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?
Michael: You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
Dwight: We have better service than they do!
Michael: ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Creed: That is correct.
Michael: Say hi to the kids.
Creed: Hi kids.
Michael: Yaaaaay.
Creed: Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? 
Kids: Ewwww!
Michael: What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
Creed: Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
Michael: No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #430]

Michael: You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
Kids: No way.
Michael: It's true. I did.
Melissa: You serious?
Jake: Really?
Michael: I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
Abby: That doesn't sound like a show.
Melissa: What?!
Michael: It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
Ryan: Right. Okay.
Michael: I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Ryan: Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Melissa: You know, I can go with him.
Michael: Oka--
Ryan: No! I will... go.
Michael: Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #431]

Michael:  Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #432]

Michael: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #433]

Michael: I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Miss Trudy:  ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in?  Let's have some fun!
Michael: That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Dwight: Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Michael: Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
Jim: That's pretty funny.
Michael: Yeah.
Edward R. Meow: ...Recess! Hey, what's your name?
Chet: My name's Chet.
Edward R. Meow: Well hi Chet.
Oscar: Is that Chet Montgomery?
Michael: Uhh, I don't know.
Pam: That is!
Darryl: Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
Edward R. Meow: What do you want to be when you grow up?
Chet: I want to be on TV!
Dwight:  And he
Michael: Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
Edward R. Meow: Okay, next? So, whats your name?
Michael: Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
Edward R. Meow: Well what's your favorite subject at school?
Young Michael: Recess.
Edward R. Meow: Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Young Michael: I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend.
Edward R. Meow:  Uh, ah... oh, okay! Well uh, nice talking with you, Michael. Uh, back to you Miss Trudy!
Miss Trudy: Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day.
Michael: Coulda sworn there was...
Melissa: Did you get married?
Michael: ...uh, no.
Abby: Why not?
Michael: Uh, just never happened.
Sasha: So, do you have any kids?
Michael: Uh, nope.
Jake: Do you have a girlfriend?
Michael: I do okay.
Melissa: Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?
Michael: Yes.
Jake: Even I have a girlfriend.
Michael: Okay! Alright, okay.
Sasha: So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.
Michael: ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #434]

Michael:  Yeah?
Toby: I think these belong to you. 
Michael: Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
Toby: Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Michael: Thank you.
Toby: Is everything okay?
Michael: You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Toby: Uh... it's true...


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #435]

Michael: Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
Toby: Mmhmm.
Michael: Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
Toby: Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
Michael: What about...
Toby: Not Jan.
Michael: ...Jan. Kay.
Toby: If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Michael: ...Or biologically.
Toby: Somehow.
Michael: Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
Toby: Yes.
Michael: Oh... kay.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #436]

Michael: Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #437]

Kevin: Go ahead.
Abby: Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
Jim: Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? 
Kevin: What're you doing? You never have plans.
Jim: Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Kevin: Niiice.
Michael: Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
Michael:  You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
Jim: Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Pam: I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. 
Michael and Dwight:  ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams...
Pam: My theory is that... 
Michael and Dwight:  ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...
Dwight: And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Michael: One more time.  You...


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #438]

Darryl: You must be pretty strong, huh?
Jake: Yeah.
Roy: You think you can beat up Darryl?
Jake: Yeah. I don't know, maybe.
Roy: I think you might be able to.
Darryl: You think you could beat me up?
Jake: Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Darryl: Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
Jake: I got some muscles. You wanna see the muscles? Bam! Look at that.
Michael: Hey, don't touch him, please!
Darryl: Man, you have got to be kidding me.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #439]

Michael: Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys.  Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.


[Date: March 16, 2006, Session #440]

Jake: Can I have a quarter? I promise I'll pay you back.
Michael: Sure.
Jake: Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.
Michael: Okay. There you go.
Jake: Will you marry my mom?


[Date: March 30, 2006, Session #441]

Michael: So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
Oscar: Who is this guy again?
Michael: Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
Ryan: Who uses calling cards anymore?
Michael: You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
Oscar: This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Michael: Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Toby: Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
Michael: You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
Jim: No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Michael: Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's...  ... I have to go make a call.

Michael: Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
Dwight: Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Michael: Good luck. One of a kind.
Dwight: Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Michael: Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Dwight: Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Michael: Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Dwight: Let's get the party started. 
Michael: Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! 


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #446]

Pam: Michael, I have Jan on the line.
Michael: Oh, great, put her through.
Jan: Hello, Michael.

Jan: I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Michael: It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Jan: Well, today's not my birthday, so...
Michael: Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Jan: ...Happy birthday, Michael.

[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #450]

Michael: When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #451]

Michael:  Stop it. Stop! What is that?
Dwight: It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
Michael: Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
Dwight: I probably care more than she does.
Michael: You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #452]

Dwight: Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Michael: What?
Dwight: Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Michael:  Ohhh, God.
Dwight: There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Michael: Ohhh, no.
Dwight: So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Oscar: ...I'll do it.
Michael: Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
Dwight: Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Pam: ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Jim: Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Dwight: On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Happy birth moment, Michael.
Michael: Thank you.
Dwight: One. Two. Three! 
Michael: Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
Dwight: Oscar...
Oscar: It wasn't me.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #453]

Dwight: Here they come.
Michael: Get in here... everybody.
Dwight: Come and get it!

Oscar: What is this?
Dwight: Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
Michael: The best.
Stanley: These are all the same?
Michael: Yes.
Angela: Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
Michael: Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Angela: No.
Michael: Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Angela: No.
Michael: Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #454]

Michael: When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #455]

Office Staff:  Happy birthday dear Michael,  Happy birthday...  ...tooo youuuu.
Kevin: Hello? Hey.
Michael: Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Kevin: No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye.  It was just Stacy.
Michael: Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Dwight: Here we go. Make a wish.
Michael: Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... 
Dwight: Yaoo yay! 
Michael: ... I asked for trick candles.
Dwight: Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Michael: Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
Angela: No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Michael: ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us .


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #456]

Toby:  Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
Michael: There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Kevin: Still scary.
Michael: Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
Kevin: Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Michael: And laughter... also.
Toby: I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
Michael: Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
Toby: I work here.
Michael:  Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
Kevin: If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
Michael: Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #457]

Dwight: Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Jim: Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
Dwight: Please, don't.
Jim: You... owe me.
Michael: Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
Stanley: Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Michael: How dare you sir. You are gross.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #458]

Michael:  That should not be there.
Dwight: I'll get someone to take it down.
Michael: No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #459]

Michael: Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #460]

Pam: I got it.
Michael: Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Jim: ...It's something to think about.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #461]

Kevin: I can't relax about it, you know?
Michael: Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Kevin: No, not yet.
Michael: Okay. Well. Live strong.
Kevin: Okay, Michael.
Michael: Alright.
Carol: Michael?
Michael: Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Carol: Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
Michael: Oh, these... all your kids?
Carol: No just the front two.
Michael: Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
Carol: Sure.
Michael: Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #462]

Michael: Push. Good! That's great. You got it.  Excuse me.
Kevin: Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks.  It was negative.
Michael: Oh... God...  God!  We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here .


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #463]

Michael: Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #464]

Kevin: This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
Michael: Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Dwight: Turn it around. Turn it around.
Michael: Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Dwight: Number one!!
Michael: Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: This is from all of us.
Michael: Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #465]

Dwight: Let's get the party started.
Michael: That's not how I taught you, right?  My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out 


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #466]

Michael: Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #467]

Michael: Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
Ryan: I won't.
Michael: Good. Great.
Ryan: Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
Michael: No, I think you're gonna stay.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #468]

Michael: On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.


[Date: March 31, 2006, Session #469]

Michael:  Mmm-hmm.
Ryan: Hey. I got the information.
Michael: Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.
Ryan:  'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Michael: Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
Ryan:  'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
Michael: Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Ryan: For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Michael: Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
Ryan: The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
Michael: Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #470]

Michael: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #471]

Michael:  Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
Jim: What?
Michael:  Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #472]

Michael: So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?
Jim: Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
Michael: Oh, that's a good idea.
Dwight: Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
Michael: Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #473]

Michael: T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #474]

Michael: And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
Stanley: I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
Michael: Oh, no you di-int.
Stanley: I think I did.
Michael: W-why did you...
Stanley: Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?
Michael: Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #475]

Michael:  To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah!


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #476]

Oscar:  That's supposed to be confidential.
Michael:  He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
Michael:  A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
Michael: ...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Pam: Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
Michael:  ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #477]

Michael:  Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
Jan:  It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
Michael: Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
Jan: No.
Michael: Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
Jan: No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
Michael: Um...
Michael:  Could you...?
Jan: Are you there Michael?
Michael: Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
Michael: Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
Michael: ...come on, Jan!
Michael: You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
Jan: Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
Michael: Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
Jan: You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
Michael: No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
Jan: And you had a luau....
Michael: ...it happens once every billion years.
Jan: And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
Michael: Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
Jan: Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
Michael: Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #478]

Michael: This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters.  Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.  'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #479]

Michael:  The Dundie award for 'Longest Engagement' goes to Pam Beesley.
Michael: Pam, everybody! 
Michael: Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
Roy:  Yes.
Michael:  Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
Roy:  Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
Michael:  Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #480]

Michael: I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
Jim: No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, 'world's longest engagement', um, we're all expecting it, you know?
Michael: That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
Jim: Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
Michael: Oh,  lazy. Uh huh.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #481]

Pam: You're taking away our bathroom?
Dwight: We are going to have two men's rooms.
Phyllis: But where would we...go?
Dwight: Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to...
Pam: Michael...
Michael: Yes.
Pam: ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
Michael: Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
Dwight: Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
Michael: Just don't, don't talk-
Dwight: ...for people's behavior.
Michael: Don't talk-
Dwight: And it's-
Michael: Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #482]

Michael: Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
Dwight:  Yes!
Michael: Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
Dwight:  Best Dundies ever.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #483]

Michael: The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.'  Card!


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #484]

Michael: You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-'
Dwight: The waitress tripped on the cord.
Michael: Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #485]

Kevin:  Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Michael: Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
Stanley: You said, we could bring our families.
Michael: I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
Stanley: I did, my wife's name is Terri.
Michael: Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.
Stanley: It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #486]

Michael:  Shut it.  Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
Dwight: Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Michael: No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
Dwight: Yeah?
Michael: And I was about to take her bra off...
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
Dwight: Like an AIDS test?
Michael: No!  God.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #487]

Michael: ...the 'Busiest Beaver' award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
Michael: Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
Phyllis: This says 'Bushiest Beaver'.

Kelly: This is a bowler-
Michael: I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
Kelly: Yeah, but everyone else-
Michael: Just sit down Kelly.

Michael: Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
Michael:  Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-
Guy At Bar: You suck man!
Michael: Let's cut it. 
Michael:   I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened.  This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the 'Don't Go in There After Me' award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
Michael: There you go.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #498]

Pam: Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.

[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #499]

Michael: And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
Michael: ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
Michael: It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #500]

Michael: Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen!  Oh, here we go.
Pam: I have so many people to thank for this award.
Pam: Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them.  Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because  this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
Pam: Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
Pam: And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
Michael: Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #501]

Michael: Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #502]

Michael: Great work tonight.
Dwight: Watch your step.
Michael: Excellent.
Dwight: Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
Michael: Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #503]

Michael: TMI. Too much information. I used to say, 'Don't go there,' but that is so lame now. Or, 'You go, girl.' Or... Um, when did 'Where's the beef?' That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #504]

Michael: All right, we need something for Kevin.
Jim: Mmm-hmmm.
Michael: What do we know about him? He's an accountant.
Jim: He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He's a bowler.
Michael:  He's fat. The fat accountant award.
Jim: Well, you seem to have this under control.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #505]

Michael: I am the fat accountant.
Dwight: Michael, I need to talk to you.
Michael: Here he is.
Dwight: I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
Michael: Really? What did they say? 'For a good time, call Michael Scott'?
Jim: Good one.
Dwight: Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
Michael: Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: ...and you just walk negatively.
Michael: Do you want me to find out what it says?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: By any means necessary?
Michael: What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?
Dwight: It's the ladies' room.
Michael: Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don't tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy.
Michael: Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael.
Jim: What award would you like to give Dwight?
Michael: I hadn't planned on including him.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Kevin.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #506]

Michael: Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
Kelly: No, we were just hoping you wouldn't do those characters, like last time.
Michael: Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.
Oscar: I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Michael: Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.
Oscar: Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
Michael:  Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #507]

Phyllis: Dwight, get out of here!
Dwight: No, no, no.
Phyllis: You can't be in here!
Dwight: It's not what you think.
Phyllis: Shut up. You're a freak!
Dwight: I'm on official business.
Phyllis: You are...
Dwight: This is Dunder Mifflin...
Phyllis: I'm telling Michael.
Dwight: No. Phyllis, you're not...
Phyllis: I'm telling Michael.
Dwight: Phyllis, no. No.
Phyllis: Michael, Michael.
Dwight: Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
Phyllis: Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
Michael: What?
Dwight: That is not true.
Phyllis: He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
Dwight: That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
Michael: Dwight, you've hit a new low here.
Phyllis: That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Dwight: What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Michael: That is a good point.
Phyllis: Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
Michael: Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.
Phyllis: When?
Michael: Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.
Phyllis: All right.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #508]

Michael: Here we go.  And that.  Hey. How you doing?


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #509]

Michael:  You down with the Dundies?
Dwight: Yeah, you know me.
Michael:  You down with the Dundies?
Dwight: The Dundies!
Michael:  You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies
Dwight: You know me.
Michael:  You down with the Dundies?
Dwight: Yeah, you know me.
Michael:  Yeah, all the homies


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #510]

Michael: I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I... 


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #511]

Michael: All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #512]

Toby: I'm just saying I don't think it's appropriate for you to have given Ryan that award.
Michael: He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?
Toby: Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.
Michael:  It was unanimous, Toby.
Toby: It wasn't a vote. You decided.
Michael: Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.
Toby: Okay, that is not true.
Michael: Yes, it is true.
Toby: Cause Ryan asked me to talk to you.
Michael: Okay, I don't have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration.  Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade...


[Date: September 20, 2005, Session #513]

Michael: Don't wanna forget that.
Manager: You and your party really need to leave right now.
Michael: Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?
Manager: You know what? Don't worry about it.
Michael: Keep it. My gift.  Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.
Manager: That's fine.

[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #514]

Dwight: I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Ryan: I go to a lot of parties.
Dwight: Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
Ryan: I am not giving you my keys.
Dwight: Don't make me do this the hard way.
Ryan: What's the hard way?
Dwight: I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
Ryan: Yeah, let's do it that way.
Michael: Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
Dwight: I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Jim: Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Dwight: I volunteered for this job.
Jim: And that's not the same.
Dwight: It is my duty...
Jim:  Volunteer duty.
Dwight: ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Michael:  Narc!
Kevin: 
Dwight: If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
Michael: I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
Dwight: Well, you have...
Michael: Uuf, well...
Dwight: ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Michael:  Okay...
Dwight: ...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Michael: Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, where's my office?  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
Jim: Well, your office is behind you.
Michael: Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #515]

Michael: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
Kevin: That is so good, Michael
Michael: Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, who's in trouble?


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #516]

Dwight: Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Michael: Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Dwight: Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Oscar: Is that true, Toby?
Toby: Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #517]

Michael: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #518]

Michael: Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
Dwight: No you can't do that.
Michael: I can do that, it is my office.
Dwight: No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
Michael: Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #519]

Michael: It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
Phyllis: We don't feel that way.
Angela: No, not at all.
Oscar: You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Michael: No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'
Dwight: Thank you, Michael.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #520]

Michael: I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #521]

Michael: Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Stanley: Where did you get these facts?
Michael: Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Stanley: They are not.
Michael: Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Stanley: No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
Michael: Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Toby: Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
Michael: Yes it is.
Toby: No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
Michael: Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
Toby: You can't do that.
Michael: I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Toby: That's not random.
Michael: Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
Pam: I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Michael: Really? 
Pam: Uh, hmmm.
Michael: Jim it's okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he's doing it, okay.  It's okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #522]

Michael: The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
Dwight: No, you will be tested.
Michael: Yes, I will not be.
Dwight: You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Michael: Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #523]

Michael: So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Dwight: What kind of filing?
Michael: Just forget it.  Just the urine.
Dwight: That goes directly to the tester.
Michael: Just. I need your urine.
Dwight: Like in a cup?
Michael: Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
Dwight: For what purpose?
Michael: It's none of your business.
Dwight: Then I refuse.
Michael: Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
Dwight: Are you serious?
Michael: I need clean urine for the lady.
Dwight: But that's illegal.
Michael: Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
Dwight: Not my urine.
Michael: A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
Dwight: Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Michael: No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #524]

Michael: Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
Dwight: That's great.
Michael: What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Dwight: It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Michael: Why?  Wha...
Dwight: I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #525]

Michael: Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
Dwight: Really?
Michael: Yes, sir.
Dwight: That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Michael: So you wanna? Thanks.
Hank: Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
Michael: Okay.
Hank: Here's your badge.
Dwight: Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great.   Can I have a gun?
Hank: No, I don't have a gun.
Dwight: Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Hank: I don't think so.
Michael: Good.
Dwight:  Thank you, Michael.
Michael: No. Oh. Uh...
Dwight: I need to go over some details with you.
Michael: Alright.  Well, Thank you.
Dwight: First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Hank: Two.
Dwight: Oh, God.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #526]

Michael: Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
Oscar: How?
Michael: Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
Oscar: No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Creed: I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Michael: Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #527]

Michael: One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
Stanley: Excuse me?
Michael: No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.
Phyllis: It's not me, either.
Michael: No? okay, fine.
Jan:  Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Michael: Okay, well, I really think that... 
Pam: Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Michael: Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
Dwight: Make-up sex. Nice!
Kevin: Nice.
Michael: Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?


[Date: April 27, 2006, Session #528]

Michael: Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.
Dwight: just drink a lot of water.
Michael: Well...
Dwight: You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
Michael: I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #529]

Michael: Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #530]

Michael: That's a nice tie.
Ryan: Thank you.
Michael: That is... who makes that?
Ryan: Um, I don't...
Michael: Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Ryan: Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #531]

Oscar: It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Michael:  What's the dealio?
Toby: Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Michael: What's the problem?
Oscar: Angela!
Toby: It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Oscar: Since Christmas.
Michael: So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Oscar: No.
Toby: Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Michael: Yes.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #532]

Toby: Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Michael: Yeah?
Toby: These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Michael: Okay.
Toby: It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
Michael: What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Toby: Okay.
Michael: Okay... what?
Toby: That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Michael: Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #533]

Michael:  A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Angela: Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Michael: No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Oscar: What's the next one?
Michael: Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Angela: Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Michael: Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #534]

Michael:  Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
Angela: I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Michael: Come on, seriously, that?
Oscar: I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Michael: Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Pam: Win!
Michael: Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Oscar: No.
Angela: That's... no...
Michael: Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Angela: How about, I leave it up?
Oscar: How 'bout, she takes it down?
Pam: How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Michael: Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
Pam: Win.
Oscar: Fine.
Angela: But, it...
Michael:  It is done!
Pam: Win


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #535]

Toby: You solved it?
Michael: Yes.
Toby: Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. 
Michael: Are those all the other complains?
Toby: Mmm-Hm.
Michael: I would like to see those please.
Toby: I... I can't do that.
Michael: You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Toby: That... 
Michael: Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?
Toby:  It's all Dwight's.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #536]

Michael: Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #537]

Michael:  This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
Pam: Nice.
Michael: You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #538]

Michael: How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
Angela: You already did me.
Michael: That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Toby: Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Michael: Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
Dwight: Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Pam:  Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Michael: All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Pam: Wait, what did it say?
Michael: Uh... 'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?'  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #539]

Michael: Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
Ryan: My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Kelly: I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Toby: To your HR representative.
Kelly: To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Toby: Fine, I'll take your name off.  So no one will know.
Michael:  Makin' progress.  Yes?
Jim: Dwight tried to kiss me.
Michael: What?!
Jim: And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Dwight: That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Jim: Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Dwight: Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Toby: Sure.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #540]

Michael: Stanley. 
Pam:  Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Michael:  You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Anglea: I didn't do it! 
Pam: I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #541]

Michael: Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
Stanley: I didn't say that.
Creed: Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? 
Michael: Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Phyllis: No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Michael: And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Phyllis: Stanley and I are close, too.
Stanley: We sit close.
Michael: Oh... ok.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #542]

Phyllis: I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
Angela: Yes, that's the problem.
Phyllis: I guess so...
Michael: Okay, well... all settled, then.
Phyllis:  I don't like you.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #543]

Michael: OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #544]

Michael: All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Kevin: I accept your decision!


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #545]

Phyllis: But I didn't report your snoring-
Stanley: Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... 
Michael: Uh. Dwight.
Dwight: Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Michael: Okay! Calm down.
Dwight: No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Michael: Hey, hey!
Dwight: Him or me?
Michael: Stop.
Dwight: Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Michael: Okay...
Dwight: Either he goes, or I go.
Michael: Dwight...
Dwight: You choose!
Michael: Stop...
Dwight: One of us is out of here by the end of today! 
Michael: Oh... kay...


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #546]

Dwight: I am not bluffing!
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Okay?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: I deserve this. You know I do!
Michael:  You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Dwight: You have till five.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #547]

Dwight: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Michael: Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #548]

Michael: Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #549]

Michael: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.'  'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #550]

Michael:  'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.'  'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #551]

Michael:  'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'

Michael: By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #553]

Michael: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #554]

Michael: Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
Dwight: So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Michael: Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Dwight: I want an answer by tomorrow.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #555]

Michael: Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Dwight: Fine.
Michael: Good. Okay.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #556]

Michael: Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Photographer: I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Michael: Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
Photographer: You mean digital?
Michael: It'll take like two seconds.
Photographer: 20 bucks.
Michael: Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Stanley: You gotta be kiddin' me.
Michael: Come on, everybody.
Dwight: Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #557]

Photographer: One, two, three... smile.  Try to smile.
Michael: We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Photographer: Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three...  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. 
Michael: Good, let's check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
Photographer: That'll be another 20.
Michael: What?
Pam: Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
Michael:  You just press the button.
Angela: What?
Jim: No, Pam.
Pam:  I am.  It's about the Save The Date.
Jim: Pam, it wasn't her.
Pam: What?!
Jim: I'm the one who complained about you.
Jim: I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.
Michael:  Okay, good. Check that out.
Jim: You know, it was one day.
Michael:  That's terrible.
Jim: And I took it right back. It was like...
Pam: Okay.
Phyllis: Oh, dear.
Michael:  Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. 


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #558]

Michael: It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #559]

Michael:  One, two.. Didn't say three, did I?


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #560]

Michael: But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #561]

Michael: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #562]

Michael: Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
Ryan: I know.
Michael: On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #563]

Michael: I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #564]

Michael: There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #565]

Michael: There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show.  And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #566]

Michael: Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.


[Date: May 4, 2006, Session #567]

Michael: Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #568]

Michael: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #569]

Michael: I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Jan:  Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Michael: Top 80 percent!
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Jan: You know that I'm very serious here.
Michael: Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Jan: What?
Michael: Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
Jan: I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael: I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Jan:  I think you can handle it.
Michael: Oh, come on. Come on.
Jan: I think so, Michael...
Michael: You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan: Goodbye, Michael.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #570]

Michael: Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #571]

Michael: Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Oscar: Again? We do that every year.
Michael: Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Oscar: It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Michael: Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Jim: That doesn't exist anymore.
Michael: Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Pam: No, they stopped making that show.
Michael: Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
Angela: You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #572]

Michael: Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Toby: Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Michael: Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Jim: I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Michael: No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Phyllis: Afghani.
Michael: What?
Phyllis: Afghani.
Michael: That's a dog.
Pam: No, that's Afghan.
Michael: That's a shawl.
Dwight: Wait, canine AIDS?
Michael: No. Humans with AIDS.
Creed: Who has AIDS?
Jim: Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Michael: Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #573]

Michael: There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.'  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #574]

Michael: I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
Darryl: Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Michael: It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Darryl: Except my warehouse.
Michael: Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
Dwight: Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
Michael: Why are you here?
Dwight: When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Michael: Not. I said, not that.
Darryl: We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Michael: That's ironic.
Darryl: What?
Michael: That you are afraid.
Darryl: Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
Michael: Dinkin' flicka.
Darryl:  Dinkin' flicka.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #575]

Michael: Give me some. 


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #576]

Michael:  Yes
Pam:  Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Michael: Who?
Pam: Carol Stills.
Michael: Do I know a Carol Stills?
Pam: Your realtor.
Michael: Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
Pam: It's still me.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #577]

Pam: Carol, you're on with Michael.
Carol:  Hello, Michael?
Michael: Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Carol: I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Michael: Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Carol: Oh, great.
Michael: Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
Carol: Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
Michael: Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Carol: Oh, great.
Michael: Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Carol: To the casino thing?
Michael: Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
Carol: What?
Michael: Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Pam: Michael, Jan's on line two.
Michael: Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
Pam: It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Hey, Jan. How you doing?
Jan: You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Michael: I am?
Jan: I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jan: Incidentally, what is the charity?
Michael: AIDS.
Jan: Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
Michael: Okay, sounds great.
Jan: Bye-bye.
Michael: Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Carol: No problemo.
Michael: Right.
Carol: To answer your question...
Michael: Yeah?
Carol: Yes.
Michael: What?
Carol: I'd love to go.
Michael: Okay.
Carol: I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
Michael: Problem. Good.
Carol: And I'll bring the papers, too.
Michael: Good, All right. Sounds great.
Carol: I'll see you tonight.
Michael: Bye.
Carol: Bye.
Michael: Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #578]

Pam:  Oh, my God!
Roy: Yeah! That's great.
Michael: Hey, hey.
Carol: Hi.
Michael: Hey, Carol.
Carol: Hi.
Michael: You look great.
Carol: Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Michael: Oh, well... Kiss.  That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight 
Dwight: Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #579]

Michael: Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Carol: Drink would be good.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #580]

Billy's Girlfriend: I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Billy: No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart.
Billy's Girlfriend: Okay.
Michael: Billy, your nurse is hot.
Billy: That's my girlfriend.
Michael: Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Billy: She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
Michael: Chili's is great.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #581]

Michael: Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Stanley:  Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Michael: Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Dealer: Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
Michael: All-in. 


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #582]

Michael: Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #583]

Toby: I'll call.
Michael: What are... That's insane.
Toby: I have good cards.
Michael: Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Dealer: No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in.
Michael: Okay, all right, whatever.
Dealer: Flip them.
Michael: You really screwed that up. 
Meredith: Wow.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #584]

Carol: Wow, bad luck.
Michael: Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Jan.
Jan: Hi.
Michael: Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
Jan: What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Carol: What does that mean?
Michael: After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Jan: No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
Carol: Hi, hi.
Jan: Does anyone want a drink?
Carol: No, I'm good.
Jan: Okay. 
Michael: Um...
Dwight: Hey, hey.
Michael: Hey. What...
Dwight: Jan's here.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #585]

Michael: All right!
Dealer: The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!
Dwight: Come on, shooter!
Michael: Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!
Carol: All right.
Michael: Yeah!
Dealer: Five.
Michael: So close. So close.
Dwight: Come on.  So where you staying? Radisson?
Jan: What?
Dwight: Super 8?
Jan: No, I...
Dwight: Motel 6? Best Western?
Jan: I didn't... I don't know...
Dwight: Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #586]

Jan: Hey. I'm leaving.
Michael: Hey, okay.
Jan: So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
Michael: Okay. Thanks for coming.
Jan: Nice to meet you.
Carol: You, too.
Jan: And you guys have a good time together.
Michael: Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Jan: Yeah.
Carol: Goodbye.
Michael: Good night. She's a good boss.
Carol: She seems really nice.
Michael: Oh, she's great.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #587]

Michael: Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #588]

Michael: Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
Dwight: Do you need anything?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Should I get water or donuts?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
Oscar: What's going on, Michael?
Michael: I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Dwight: Office Depot!
Michael: Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. 


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #589]

Michael: How about a location?
Dwight: The planet Caprica.
Michael: Where the hell is that?
Dwight: It's from Battlestar Galactica.
Michael: Okay, all right.
Stanley: I am going back to my desk...
Michael: No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
Stanley: Annoying.
Michael: We already have that. So...
Toby: Frustrating.
Michael: No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Phyllis: Ass.
Michael: Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
Dwight: Yeah, get them, Creed!
Michael: One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #590]

Michael: Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
Darryl: Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Michael: Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Darryl: What?
Michael: Paper money.  Yeah. The company's doing fine.
Darryl: Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Michael: Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.


[Date: May 11, 2006, Session #591]

Michael: Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #592]

Michael:  Hey, what's up?
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Any emails today?
Jim: Um... I don't think so.
Michael: No? Um... Check your spam folder.
Jim: Oh! There it is!
Michael: What?
Jim: Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Michael: 
Jim: Well done.
Michael: Kay.
Jim: Topical.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #593]

Michael: I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #594]

Dwight: So the monkey does the sex thing right here! 
Michael: That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
Dwight: Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Michael: Um, I...
Dwight: Consider it?
Michael: Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's...  Whup! Come on! Hey!
Todd Packer: What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom?  This guy!
Michael: Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
Todd Packer: 
Michael: Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
Todd Packer: bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?
Michael: Uh oh.
Todd Packer: Still queer?
Michael: Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #595]

Michael: Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #596]

Michael: Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
Todd Packer: Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
Michael: Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Todd Packer: We're talking blonde incompetent.
Michael: Oh, yeah.
Todd Packer: Like 10 words a minute... talking.
Michael: Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
Todd Packer: They are women, right?
Michael: Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
Todd Packer: I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Michael: Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #597]

Todd Packer: Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
Michael: Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan? 
Todd Packer:  Come on, kid. Let's go.
Michael: Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Jim: Except pass that breathalyzer.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #598]

Michael: Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. 'Old School'.
Toby: Michael?
Michael: Yes, Toby?
Toby: Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Michael: Um... literally two seconds?


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #599]

Michael: Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #600]

Toby: The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
Michael: No, no, Toby. No.
Toby: It's really not a big deal, Michael.
Michael: It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
Toby: And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
Michael: What?
Toby: Just to refresh you... .
Michael: NO!
Toby: on our policy.
Michael: What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Toby: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Michael: There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #601]

Michael: Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away.
Toby: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Michael: I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #602]

Michael: A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says 'Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?' This is what's at stake.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #603]

Michael: Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Darryl: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Michael: Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Darryl: Well,  those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Roy: Boys R Us!
Warehouse Guy: Oh!
Michael: Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Darryl: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Michael: Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
Roy: Hey, hey, hey.
Michael: What?
Roy: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
Michael: I don't feel bad.
Darryl:  I think he feels bad.
Michael: No, I don't.
Roy: You look like you feel bad.
Michael: Okay.
Roy: Little package!
Michael: Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Warehouse guy: Little package! Little package!
Michael: Thank you.
Roy: You look good.
Darryl: Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse guys: 


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #604]

Pam: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Toby: Great point.
Pam: Thank you.
Toby: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Michael: Hi, is it over?
Toby: Uh, yes!
Michael: No.
Toby: I can go over it with you.
Michael: I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Toby: It's over.
Michael: Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
Angela: Email forwards.
Michael: Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Angela: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Michael: Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Stanley: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Meredith: Um... what about office romance?
Toby: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Phyllis: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Michael: I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
Dwight: Yeah, Meredith.
Michael: No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: She would have definitely slept with me.
Kevin: She wasn't that hot.
Michael: Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
Toby: Ok, you know, Michael...


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #605]

Michael: What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?
Toby: No.
Michael: What if they made out? In front of everybody?
Toby: Well, that would be...
Michael: At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Toby: Okay, I'm lost.
Michael: Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #606]

Video: 
Michael: I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Jim: No, thanks. I'm good.
Michael: That's what she said. Pam?
Pam: Uh... my mother's coming.
Michael: That's what she sai   Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #607]

Man in Video: In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
Video: 
Roy: Natural redhead.
Actor: Hey, Rach.
Redheaded Actress: Hey, Joe. Mike.
Actor: Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
Darryl: Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing.  I banged this girl right here. This is...
Roy: That's her?
Darryl: Yes, this is the one.
Roy: No!
Darryl: You remember? Yes!
Roy: At the party?
Warehouse guy: You banged her?
Darryl: Yes!   Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #608]

Jan:  Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then.  Hi.
Michael: Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #609]

Michael: So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Mr. O'Malley: I love lawyer jokes.
Michael: Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #610]

Michael: When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #611]

Jan: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Michael: The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Jan: Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Michael: Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
Jan: Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Michael: No, I've seen the video.
Toby:  He talked the whole time.
Michael: No, I didn't.  Huh, what? 


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #612]

Michael: Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Jim: Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Michael: Mmmhmm. Yes.
Jim: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Michael: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Jan: Michael. MICHAEL!
Michael:  Come on.
Jan: Michael, please.
Todd Packer: There he is.
Michael: Mwah! 
Todd Packer: There he is. Good one.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #613]

Michael: You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
Jan: Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
Michael: It's... That's...
Jan: That's not my sense of humor.
Michael: Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
Jan: Wha...
Michael: I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny:  And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
Michael: This guy does it all.
Jan:  'Scuse me, I'm sorry.  Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Michael: What?
Jan: Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Michael: So I'm not in trouble?


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #614]

Michael: I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #615]

Michael: Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Albiny: Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
Michael: I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #616]

Todd Packer: There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... 
Kevin: Phyllis?
Michael: No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Todd Packer: Ex-squeeze me?
Michael: Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
Kevin: Packer said it.
Michael: No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Phyllis: I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Michael: I don't know about that.
Phyllis: We're in the same High School class.
Michael: Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Kevin: You mean where my desk is?
Michael: Yes, your corner. Go.
Kevin: Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Michael: Mmmhmmm.
Todd Packer: Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
Michael: They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on.
Phyllis: Michael! Come on!
Michael: Oooh!
Phyllis: You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Michael: I'm not worried.
Phyllis: ...report you to HR.
Michael: You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #617]

Michael: Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #618]

Michael: Good morning, Pam.
Pam: Good morning, Michael.
Michael: What's going on?
Pam: Nothing. You look nice today.
Michael: What?
Pam: You look real thin.
Michael: I don't get what you mean.
Pam: You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
Michael: Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... 
Pam: Thin handsome, Michael.
Michael: Yes, well, of course. Of course. 


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #619]

Michael: Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
Pam: We're not dating.
Michael: No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...
Pam: We're not dating, I'm engaged.
Michael: Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
Pam: I would say no.
Michael: You say yes, and we go out.
Pam: I would drown myself.
Michael: And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.


[Date: September 27, 2005, Session #620]

Michael: Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #621]

Michael: I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
Ryan: I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
Michael: Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
Ryan: What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Michael: Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
Ryan: I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Michael: Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #622]

Michael: Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
Dwight: Diversifying. Smart.
Michael: Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
Dwight: And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
Michael: Maybe.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #623]

Dwight: You should go.
Michael: Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
Dwight: Uh huh.
Michael: Sign the papers at the condo.
Dwight: You have your lawyer there?
Michael: Uh, I don't need one.
Dwight: Can I be your representative?
Michael: I don't need a representative.
Dwight: I think I should be there.
Michael: No, No.
Dwight: I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Michael: No. Dwight. I'm fine.
Dwight: Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
Michael: Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
Dwight: So you're taking a personal day?
Michael: Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
Dwight: Please, I'll make you proud.
Michael: Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
Dwight: Yes! As your representative?
Michael: As my associate.
Dwight: Same thing.
Michael: No it is not.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #624]

Michael: Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
Pam: You headed out?
Michael: We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
Pam: Ok.
Michael: Very good.
Pam: Have a great time.
Michael: We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
Pam: Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
Michael: Good. The Small Business Man?
Pam: Yup.
Michael: Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
Pam: Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
Michael: How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
Pam: 
Michael: NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Ok. See you soon.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #625]

Dwight: What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
Michael: I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
Dwight:  I want to put the top down.
Michael: What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please...
Dwight: But then no one can see us.
Michael: I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
Dwight: Check it out.  Terminator.
Michael: I do not understand what you spend your money on.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #626]

Michael: Home, sweet home.
Dwight: Which one's yours?
Michael: Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #627]

Carol: Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
Michael: Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
Bill: Nice to meet you.
Michael: Nice to meet you too.
Dwight: This is smaller than your old place.
Michael: Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #628]

Carol: Are we ready to sign some papers?
Dwight: Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Bill: It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles.
Carol: It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
Michael: Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
Dwight: Let's go check out the master bedroom.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #629]

Michael: This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
Dwight: Oh. Terrible idea.
Michael: I'm putting my bed right over here.
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Michael: Well, then I will get a warrantee.
Dwight: Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
Michael: Well then I won't get a warrantee.
Dwight: Shh Shh.
Michael: So that's the problem, is solved. What?
Dwight: Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #630]

Carol: And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
Dwight: What kind of mortgage did you get?
Michael: Uh... Ten year.
Carol: Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
Michael: What? Wha? You said ten.
Carol: Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
Dwight: Ho, thirty years.
Michael: Ok, ok, ok.
Dwight: Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Michael: Alright.
Dwight: Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Michael: Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
Dwight: Well, this is it.
Carol: Whenever you're ready.
Michael: Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
Carol: Actually yes.
Dwight: Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
Michael: Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
Dwight: We'll be here waiting for you.
Michael: Oh, man.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #631]

Carol: Whenever you're ready, Michael.
Michael: Uh. 


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #632]

Michael: The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...
Carol: What?
Michael: ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
Carol: Michael, this is the unit you saw and...
Michael: Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
Carol: Who told you that?
Michael: As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #633]

Michael: There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #634]

Carol: Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
Michael: No, no, no.
Carol: That's some extra income for you.
Michael: I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
Carol: You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
Michael: Ehhhh....


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #635]

Michael: I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
Dwight: Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? 


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #636]

Michael: There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
Dwight: You didn't have to...
Michael: No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #637]

Michael: Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #638]

Dwight: I don't even know what to say.
Michael: I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
Dwight: Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
Michael: What the hell is a terrarium?
Dwight: It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Michael: Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
Dwight: Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #639]

Dwight: Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Michael: We take separate cars.
Dwight: Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Michael: Why would we do that?
Dwight: Just for fun?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
Michael: EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #640]

Dwight: You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
Michael: Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
Dwight: People love beets.
Michael: Nobody likes beets.
Dwight: Everybody loves beets.
Michael: Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
Dwight: Let's get this roof going.
Michael: Stop it! 
Dwight: Ow.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #641]

Jim: Michael.
Michael: Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
Jim: Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
Michael: Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
Jim: Nice.
Michael: You know.
Jim: Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Michael: Really?


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #642]

Michael: What's this?
Jim: These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.   Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. 
Michael: I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
Jim: And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
Michael: Get up here, Dwight.
Dwight: Silver medal.
Michael: Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?
Jim: Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
Michael: Oh.  What the hell is that?
Jim: Those are the doves.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #643]

Dwight: What are the specs?
Michael: Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath...
Dwight:  Nice.
Michael: ...contemporary townhouse. Two car parking...
Dwight:  Yes.
Michael: ...wall-to-wall carpets...
Dwight:  God, what a steal.
Michael: ...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.
Dwight: Does it have a deck?
Michael: I think it does.
Dwight: Have you seen it?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Does it have a deck?
Michael: I think it has a... Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #644]

Michael: When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #645]

Michael: Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. 
Dwight: It's time.
Michael: Are we ready?
Dwight: That's it.
Michael: Are we gonna do it?


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #646]

Michael: This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,
Dwight: Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
Michael: Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station.
Dwight: Same thing.
Michael: No.
Dwight: Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
Michael: Oh, anything bad?
Dwight: Two charges of loitering,
Michael: Mmm-hmm.
Dwight: one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
Michael: Mmm-hmm.
Dwight: Do you own a gun?
Michael: No.
Dwight: I'd think about it.
Michael: I don't need a gun.
Man: Hello?
Michael: Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?
Man: Uh, I don't know. It's pretty quiet.
Michael: Oh... That's gonna change. 
Man: Why?
Michael: Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
Man: Okay, but there's an 11:00 noise curfew.
Dwight: Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
Man: Who is Mr. Scott?
Dwight: Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
Man: No.
Michael: Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway.  All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #647]

Michael: I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn.  Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.
Carol: Hello.
Michael: Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?
Carol: Hello, hi. Hey, Michael.
Michael: Good to see you.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #648]

Michael: Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities.
Dwight: Seal it off.
Michael: What?  What are you doing in there?
Dwight: Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
Michael: Oh, my God. Dwight.
Dwight: Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
Michael: You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room.
Dwight: Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.
Michael: I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.
Dwight: Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
Michael: I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.
Dwight: Just a possibility.
Michael: No, it's not. Just shut up.
Dwight: If you fall in love with her.
Michael: You're an ass. Shut it.
Dwight: I smell mold.
Michael: No, you don't.


[Date: October 4, 2005, Session #649]

Michael: I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.
Carol: How?
Michael: This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #650]

Michael: Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
Ryan: The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Michael: Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! 


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #651]

Michael: Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
Ryan: Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
Michael: Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Ryan: Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Michael: That is ridiculous.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #652]

Michael: Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #653]

Michael:  Much advice you seek.  Do you know who that is?
Ryan: Fozzie bear?
Michael: Mmm... No. That was Yoda.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #654]

Michael: There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
Ryan: Got it.
Michael: And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #655]

Michael:   Hey!


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #656]

Michael: Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #657]

Michael: Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #658]

Michael: So what was rule two?
Ryan: Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
Michael: Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
Dwight: Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Michael: Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
Ryan: Uh, okay, two?
Dwight: NO!
Ryan: Okay... uh, sorry?


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #659]

Dwight: Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
Michael: Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
Ryan: No.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #660]

Ryan: ...I don't.
Dwight: Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Michael: Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
Dwight: That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #661]

Michael: Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
Ryan: Yeah.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #662]

Dwight: Is this your car, Ryan?
Michael: Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
Ryan:  Don't...
Dwight: Good shocks.
Michael: Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...
Ryan: That's actually a test prep book.
Michael: ...for Phone. What?
Ryan: That's a test prep for business school.
Michael: Um, oh, thinking about business school?
Ryan: I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Michael: Really?
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: So you think you know a lot about business?
Ryan: No, not yet.
Michael: Uh huh.
Ryan: Just started.
Michael: Yeah. Quiz me.
Ryan: I... wouldn't even know where to start.
Michael: Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
Dwight: Do it.
Michael: Quiz me up.
Ryan: All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Michael: Uh...


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #663]

Michael: When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #664]

Ryan: Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
Dwight: Keep an existing...
Michael:  Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, it's equal.
Ryan: It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Michael: Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
Dwight: Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Michael: Okay, Dwight.
Dwight: Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Michael: You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
Dwight:  Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
Michael: For instance, why don't you go to business...
Dwight:  You should learn from him, right?
Ryan: I am.
Dwight: Right?
Ryan: I am.
Michael: Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
Dwight: Stupid!


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #665]

Michael: I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #666]

Michael: Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
Ryan: It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Michael: You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #667]

Michael: I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
Ryan: Maybe we should get some air.
Michael: Nah, I'm okay.
Ryan: I'm really uncomfortable.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #668]

Stanley: Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Michael: Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
Stanley: Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
Michael: Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
Roy: Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
Angela: My name is Angela.
Roy: Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
Michael: Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?
Jim: Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Michael: Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
Roy: You're all gay.
Michael: Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
Ryan:  Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
Michael: Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
Dwight: Would that make you happy?
Michael: What's that?
Dwight: If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: I'm on it.
Michael: Dwight. Hey!
Angela: You can't go in yet!
Michael: Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
Kevin: What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Michael: I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #669]

Meredith: ...Jim.
Phyllis: Definitely Jim.
Kelly: Definitely, definitely, Jim.
Phyllis: Come on, Pam.
Kelly: How about you Pam?
Pam: Um... Oscar's kind of cute.
Phyllis: Yeah, I like Oscar.
Pam: Ooh, Toby!
Michael:  How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Meredith: Is there anybody else.
Kevin: 


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #670]

Jim:  Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Michael: Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.
Ryan: What's your number?
Michael: I gave it to you in the car.
Ryan: Um...
Michael: I saw you program it in.
Ryan: You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Michael: Okay. Alright.
Ryan: Now I have it.
Michael: Uh, I better tell somebody.  Excuse me, sir...
Dwight: 
Michael: Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
Dwight:  Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Michael: Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
Dwight: That's exactly what I said.
Michael: Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
Dwight: Were you absent?
Michael: Toaster Oven 101?
Dwight: You failed?
Ryan: I am so sorry.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #671]

Michael: Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #672]

Dwight: I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready?  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Dwight and Michael:  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning---
Dwight: Everybody!
Michael:  ...since the world was turning.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #673]

Dwight and Michael: 
Dwight:   ... Marilyn Monroe!
Dwight and Michael:  Ryan started the fire! It was always burning...
Dwight: Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #674]

Michael: Okay. Rule five - safety first,  i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #675]

Michael: Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #676]

Michael: I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #677]

Michael: Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.
Dwight: Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Michael: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Dwight: That is so cool.
Michael: Mmm-hmm.
Dwight: Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
Michael: No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...
Dwight: Kill or be killed.
Michael: No.
Dwight: Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.
Michael: No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
Dwight: You could ask for an extension.
Michael: I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #678]

Michael: Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #679]

Michael: When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.


[Date: October 11, 2005, Session #680]

Michael: If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.

[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #681]

Michael: Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh... that's great!
Pam: Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
Michael: Ohh... OK.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #682]

Michael: I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay.
Sherri:  Jan Levinson's office.
Michael: Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
Sherri: Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.
Michael: Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
Sherri: I just need the name of who you're planning to let go.
Michael: I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
Sherri: I know she wanted the name.
Michael: Okay... Sherri?
Sherri: Yeah?
Michael: If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
Sherri: Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.
Michael: Thanks.
Sherri: Mm-Hmm.
Michael: I'll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
Sherri: Hey, I'm still here.
Michael: Okay! I'm sorry.
Sherri: Yeah.
Michael: No?
Sherri: OK.
Michael: Bye.
Sherri: Hanging up now.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #683]

Michael: I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
Pam:  You wanted me?
Michael: Yes.
Pam:  Papier-mache?
Michael: Yes.
Pam: Hmm.
Michael: Yeeesh.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Pam: Why did you put it off until Halloween?
Michael: Because it's very scary stuff.
Pam: I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
Michael: You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
Pam: So it's a man?
Michael: No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
Pam: I just answer the phone.
Michael: And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
Pam: You're costume is fantastic! 
Michael: I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. 
Pam: Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Aah!  Okay...
Michael: Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #684]

Michael: Hey.
Oscar: Michael.
Michael: You guys excited about the party?
Angela: Yeah.
Michael: It's gonna be fun.
Kevin: Yeah.
Angela: Yes.
Michael:  Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
Oscar: What are you implying?
Michael: All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
Angela: You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
Michael: Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
Angela: Yeah.
Michael: Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
Angela: But we don't keep two sets of books.
Michael: Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #685]

Michael: Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
Kelly: Why is that?
Michael: Bend It Like Beckham.'
Kelly: Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
Michael:  Yeah. That would be perfect.
Kelly: Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
Michael: Well, I don't really have two heads. So...


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #686]

Michael: Who do you think it should be?
Dwight: Jim. Definitely.
Michael: No, Jim brings in money.
Dwight: Phyllis.
Michael: Eh.
Dwight: Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #687]

Michael: It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #688]

Dwight: One of the warehouse guys.
Michael:  What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
Dwight: Who is he saying?
Michael: You're right, I didn't even think of him.
Dwight: No, Michael.
Michael: Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
Dwight: No, not me.
Michael: Yeah... I could.
Dwight: Not Dwight.
Michael: I'm not saying that's what he said.
Dwight: I know that's what he said.
Michael:  What?
Dwight: Tell him, not Dwight.
Michael: That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
Dwight: Tell him to stop.
Michael: Are you kidding?
Dwight: Quiet, you.
Michael: I agree. He'd land on his feet.
Dwight: Make him be quiet.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #689]

Michael: So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
Dwight: He wouldn't listen to me
Michael: Ahh, come on.
Dwight: If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
Michael: I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... 


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #690]

Dwight: This is called leveraging an offer.  Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Michael: Oh, God.
Dwight: I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Michael: Fantastic!
Dwight: And I turned it down.
Michael: What?! That would've solved all my problems.
Dwight: Out of loyalty to this company...
Michael: Oh, you idiot.
Dwight: ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Michael: If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
Dwight: But then you wouldn't have me here.
Michael: Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
Dwight: It's in Maryland.
Michael: You can call. Can you call 'em?
Dwight: I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Michael: Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #691]

Jim: Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
Michael:  Can I speak to you a minute?
Jim: Um... yes.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #692]

Jim: Michael, I really didn't mean to...
Michael: Help. Me.
Jim: I'm sorry?
Michael: I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
Jim: Oh, you want me to be you?
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
Jim: Oh, are you firing Creed?
Michael: No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
Jim: We should switch seats in order to...
Michael: Yes, that's a good idea.
Jim: Alright.  Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
Michael: Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
Jim: Wow.
Michael: I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
Jim: That's an overreaction.
Michael: Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
Jim: Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
Michael: I... this is Creed.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. 
Jim: Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
Michael: And I'm very angry, and I want...
Jim:  Michael Scott here.
Michael: I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
Jim: Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
Michael: Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #693]

Michael: Uh, hey... Creed?
Creed: Huh?
Michael: Could I talk to you for a second?


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #694]

Michael: You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
Creed: What are you telling me?
Michael: I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
Creed: No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
Michael: No, you wanna leave.
Creed: No, I wanna stay here.
Michael: Why... why are you making this so hard?
Creed: Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.
Michael: I think you're right.
Creed: Can I go?
Michael: No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
Creed: Let's fight it.
Michael: Hmm?
Creed: Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Michael: What old days? What are you talking about?
Creed: Did you start the paperwork yet?
Michael: It's right here on the desk, yeah.
Creed: You don't have to do this, Michael.
Michael: I can't, I can't...
Creed: Undo it!
Michael: I can't change anything. This is the way...
Creed: No, you have the power to undo it.
Michael: I don't... okay, just listen.
Creed: Michael, undo it!
Michael: Don't...

Michael: Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #696]

Michael: I have to fire someone today, okay?
Creed: Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Michael: Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
Creed: No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
Michael: Don't...
Creed: Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #697]

Michael: Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #698]

Devon: Creed's an idiot, you know that.
Michael: Well, he...
Devon: No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.
Michael: Well, maybe I did.
Devon: Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.
Michael: Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
Devon: That's why I'm being fired?
Michael: No.
Devon: So you might not look like an idiot?
Michael: No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
Devon: This is unbelievable!
Michael: I just hope that you and I can remain friends.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #699]

Michael: Devon, wait, please.
Devon: What!
Michael: Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
Devon:  Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell!
Angela:  What about the Halloween party?


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #700]

Michael: I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #701]

Children:  Trick or treat!
Michael: He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
Kid: I'm a bumble bee.
Michael: You look great! And you're a princess?
Kid: A fairy princess.
Michael: A fairy princess. You're very... .
Kid: I'm a lion.
Michael: You're a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh!  Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #702]

Michael: Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?
Phyllis: Mmm-hmm.
Michael: Of course. You're always working hard.
Phyllis: Thanks.
Michael: Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.
Stanley: Something wrong, Michael?
Michael: No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine.  You are all such wonderful, innocent people.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #703]

Toby: Hey, Jim.
Jim: What's up, Hef?
Toby: Michael?
Michael: What? What?
Toby: Michael, do you have the name of the employee you're letting go? I'd like to start working on out-placement.
Michael: Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.
Toby: I don't report to you, Michael. I report to the head of HR in New York.
Michael: You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?
Toby: They would just send someone else. You need to have an HR representative.
Michael: Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.
Toby: I know, Michael.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #704]

Michael: I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?
Vance Refrigeration Worker #1: Hey, you wanna see a really messy show? Follow us around. Come to our office.
Michael: You know what? That's my foot.
Vance Refrigeration Worker #2: Ass, ass, ass...
Michael: You guys...
Vance Refrigeration Worker #2: ...ass, ass, ass, ass, ass...
Vance Refrigeration Worker #1: Hi, Mom!


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #705]

Michael: I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
Hank the Security Guard: Who is it?
Michael: I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?
Hank the Security Guard: Building.
Michael: Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
Hank the Security Guard: You're on your own.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #706]

Michael: All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided.  Wow, that's  a fast elevator.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #707]

Michael: I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Stanley: Yeah, We're not doing that. I have kids in college. Make a decision.
Michael: Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. 
Toby: Michael, it's almost 5:00.
Michael: Leave me alone, okay?


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #708]

Michael: Do you want some coffee?
Creed: No, no. I had some, thanks.
Michael:  Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
Creed: Fifteen years, I think.
Michael: Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.
Creed: Oh, no. I need the money.
Michael: Why?
Creed: What do you mean, 'Why?'
Michael: It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
Creed: I don't know. I got nephews.
Michael: Yeah.
Creed: Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
Michael: Just trying to be your friend.
Creed: Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
Michael: Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do.
Creed: Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
Michael: Are you pulling my leg or...
Creed: No.
Michael: You have no clue why I've asked you in here?
Creed: I do not.
Michael: Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #709]

Michael: Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #710]

Jan:  This is Jan.
Michael: His name was Devon.
Jan: Excuse me?
Michael: The human being man's name was Devon.
Jan: Devon. The... Oh, is this the man that you...
Michael:  Yes, yes, yes.
Jan: The person that you fired, Michael?
Michael: Yes, it is.
Jan: Is that what you're... Okay. Oh, you sound a little... A little upset.
Michael: Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.
Jan: Well, I have to say that I am impressed, Michael. I know... I know how hard that was.
Michael: Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
Jan: Well, I'm glad you did it, Michael.
Michael:  You're glad?
Jan: And so, good job. Good job.
Michael: Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?
Jan: Yeah. Good job.
Michael:  Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.
Jan:  Yup. Yes.
Michael: There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great.


[Date: October 31, 2005, Session #711]

Dwight: You're supposed to be a cat?
Angela: Yes.
Creed: You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.
Michael:  Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
Dwight: Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
Michael: You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #712]

Michael:  I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
Ryan: Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
Michael: Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
Ryan: Why is that secret? 
Michael:  Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
Pam: Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
Michael: Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Pam: It's just last year you...
Michael: Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
Pam: Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
Michael: Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Ryan: Updating emergency contacts.
Pam: Well, is that really a priority?
Michael: Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
Ryan: Catch-22.
Michael: Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #713]

Jim: Uh, Larissa Halpert.
Ryan: What's her address? 
Jim: 117 Mount Bergin St.
Ryan: Hello?
Michael:  Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
Ryan: Do you mean Neverland?
Michael: This is Tito.
Ryan: What?
Michael: Calling from... 


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #714]

Ryan: Who is your emergency contact? 
Kevin: Stacy.
Ryan: 
Michael:  Pick up.
Ryan: Hello?
Michael:  This is Mike Tyson.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #715]

Michael: And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
Pam: Could you practice on the forms?


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #716]

Dwight: No women or children, unless provoked.
Jim: Ok, Roy?
Dwight: Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Jim: Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
Michael: Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
Dwight: Because we're friends.
Michael: Because I would kick his ass.
Jim: Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
Michael: So? I've beaten up black belts.
Jim: Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
Michael: They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #717]

Michael: And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
Jim: Sounds tough. When you're a Jet,  you're a Jet all the way, right?
Michael: You were a Jet?
Angela: Have you signed the expense reports yet?
Michael: Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
Dwight: Argggg!


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #718]

Michael: I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #719]

Michael: Just hit me. You'll see.
Jim: I can't. I just got a manicure.
Michael: Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Jim: Just have Dwight punch you.
Michael: Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
Jim: You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Dwight: What belt are they?
Michael: Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
Dwight: No!
Michael: ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
Dwight: Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
Michael: Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
Dwight: Ok, I'll punch you.
Michael: Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
Dwight: Kiyah!
Michael: Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #720]

Jim: Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
Michael: Yeah.  Thank you.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #721]

Jim: Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
Pam: I don't know.
Jim: Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
Pam: French Onion?
Jim: Obviously.
Pam: Ok.
Jim: Yes.
Dwight:  Take this pen and stab me with it.
Michael:  Go away.
Pam: I just have a quick question.
Michael: I haven't signed them, ok?
Pam: No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
Michael: Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
Pam: He's a purple belt. That's really high.
Michael: Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
Pam: It's just out there, you...
Michael: Oh, so that's what they are saying?
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
Jim: Uh, Kitchen.
Michael: Ok.
Kelly: Hi-yah!
Dwight: Good.
Kelly: Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
Dwight: Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Kelly: What?
Michael: Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
Dwight: I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
Michael: No, Really?
Dwight: In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
Michael: Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
Dwight: Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Michael: Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
Dwight: No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Michael: Really?
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
Jim: Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
Michael: No, they must have class.
Dwight: No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Michael: Look...
Dwight: I've got the key.
Toby: Michael...
Michael: Hey, Toby.
Toby: Any word on those time cards?
Michael: I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #722]

Michael: I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
Ira: Uh, no, it's not.
Michael: I think it is. A guy told me about that.
Ira: Actually, it's a symbol for eternal discipline.
Michael: Oh.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #723]

Ira: Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?
Dwight: Yes, Sensei!
Michael: Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
Ira: Shi mate!
Dwight: Hiii! 
Michael: Hey!
Ira: Alright, break.
Michael: What the hell was that?
Dwight: Yes!
Ira: Dwight - awarded a point.
Michael: No.
Dwight: Eat it!
Michael: Alright, that's the way you want it.
Dwight: Two more.
Michael: Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
Kevin: Sweep the leg.
Michael: I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
Dwight: No.
Michael: I got his pants.
Dwight: It was my pants.
Ira: No points for pants.
Michael: Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! 
Ira: Clean single kick, gentlemen.
Michael: Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
Ira: Ok, break. Break.
Dwight: No holding.
Michael: You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points. 
Dwight: No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Michael: Open your mouth.
Dwight: No, Michael!


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #724]

Michael: You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious.  Oh, we're playing phone tag.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #725]

Michael: My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
Ryan: Fudge?
Michael:  Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
Dwight: I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Ryan: Ok, to what?
Dwight: Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. 
Michael: He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #726]

Michael:  Yeah.
Ryan: I have the emergency contacts.
Michael: Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
Ryan: Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
Michael: If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
Ryan: Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
Michael: Alright, bye.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #727]

Michael: Dwight?
Angela: Michael, did you finish yet?
Michael: This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Dwight: I'm busy.
Michael: Well,  busier. Making the time.
Stanley: Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
Toby: We want to go home.
Michael: Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
Pam: The shipping place closes in a half hour.
Michael: I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #728]

Michael: I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
Dwight: Of course.
Michael: And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
Dwight: Michael, I don't know...
Michael: I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
Dwight: I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Michael: No, no, title change only.
Dwight: I'll have Pam send out a memo.
Michael: No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
Dwight: Just a formality.
Michael: Absolutely but not really.
Dwight: Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Michael: Yes you do.
Dwight: Thank you, Sensei.
Michael: And, ditto.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #729]

Michael: I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #730]

Jim: What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?
Dwight: No problem.
Jim: I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.
Dwight: Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
Jim: True. Meredith.
Dwight: No women or children. Unless provoked.
Jim: Okay. Roy.
Dwight: Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Jim: Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?
Michael: Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.
Stanley: Excuse me?
Michael: I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.
Dwight: You just said it. You just said it.
Michael: No, that's not how I meant it.
Dwight: Die. You just... You said it.
Michael: Shut up, Dwight.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #731]

Master: Sir, your shoes.
Michael: Yes.
Master: You're gonna have to take them off. It's a sign of respect.
Michael: Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang.  Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. 
Master: Here's your gear. Please put this on.
Michael: Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #732]

Michael: God, you look like such an idiot.  


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #733]

Michael: Stan the man.
Stanley: Hi, Michael.
Michael: Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.
Stanley: No. Are those purchase orders signed?
Michael: I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
Stanley: Huh? What?
Michael: I went medieval on his heinie.
Stanley: Are those purchase orders signed?
Michael: Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...
Stanley: Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
Michael: Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay?  Okay.


[Date: November 1, 2005, Session #734]

Michael:  All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one.
Pam: This is what you had Ryan do.
Michael: Yes, under my tutelage.
Pam: Well, what about the other stuff that has to be in today?
Michael: If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.

[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #735]

Jan: This is a projection of the county's needs...
Michael: Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
Jan: Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #736]

Jan: So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
Michael: I changed it.  To Chili's.
Jan: Excuse me?
Michael: Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'.  It's kind of snooty.  So.
Jan: You had no right to do that, Michael.
Michael: Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
Jan: It said that.
Michael: It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
Jan: Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.
Michael: Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.
Jan: What?


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #737]

Michael: Ok, let's do this thing.   Wish us luck.
Dwight: Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
Jan: Thank you.
Michael:  Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.
Jan: Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
Michael: Well...
Jan: Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
Michael: No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.   That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.   Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.   Adios!


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #738]

Jan: So which way is Chili's?
Michael: Uh, I'll drive.
Jan: Oh, no, that's alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.
Michael: It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
Jan: I know Scranton.
Michael: At all!
Jan: Alright.
Michael: You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
Jan: If it's a couple blocks away-
Michael: Dar de dar.
Jan: Ok.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #739]

Michael: Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #740]

Michael: We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Jan: Why would we need a signal?
Michael: Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
Jan: What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
Michael: Well, I... it could be either of us.
Jan: You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
Michael: Yeees.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #741]

Michael: Hello?  Christian?
Christian: Yes.
Michael: Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
Jan: Just Jan Levinson.
Michael: No Gould?
Jan: No.  Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?
Christian: No, not long.
Michael: Uh, Jan, what happened?
Jan: Michael.
Michael: Is Gould dead?  What uh-
Jan: Michael, we got divorced, ok?  I'm so sorry.  Excuse me.
Michael: Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
Jan: Michael.  Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
Michael: When did this happen?
Jan: We're in a meeting.
Michael: Ok.
Hostess: This way, please.
Jan: Christian.
Michael: Alright, after you.
Christian: Thank you.
Michael: 


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #742]

Jan: I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
Christian: Right.  Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years.  So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-
Michael: Awesome blossom.
Jan: What?
Michael:  I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
Christian: Sure.
Michael: Ok, it's done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it's done.
Jan: So-
Michael: I heard a-
Jan: If you have a-
Michael: Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
Jan: Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
Christian: It's ok, I like jokes.
Michael: Ok.
Jan: Just the one.
Michael: Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #743]

Pam: Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael: Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #744]

Pam:  Ok, you want me to read 'em?
Michael: Yes.
Pam: Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
Michael: No.
Pam: When-
Michael: Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
Pam: Ok.  There's a transcript between a naval ship-
Michael: Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
Pam: Sure.  There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #745]

Michael: First guy says 'Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn'.  And the second guy says, 'Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort'.  And the third guy says 'I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe'.
Christian: Ohhh no!  Oh my God, that's funny!  I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!
Jan:   Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #746]

Michael:   Yum! Yum yum yum!   That's delicious!  I love it!
Jan: We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
Christian: Well, we are out to save money.
Jan: What's the bottom line?
Michael: Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #747]

Michael: That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words.  That's her fault.


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #748]

Michael: Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
Jan: I don't think Christian has time for that.
Christian: I have time.
Michael:  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back 
Michael and Christian:  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-
Michael:  Chili's baby back ribs...


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #749]

Christian: So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.
Michael: Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
Jan: Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.
Michael: Oh, so you're not gonna play?  She's not playing.
Christian: It's not fair.
Michael: She's not playing the game.
Jan: We'd been fighting for a while-
Michael: Check please.
Jan: He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
Christian: You didn't.
Jan: I was stupid.
Michael and Christian: No.
Michael: No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
Christian: That's right.
Michael: You know?
Christian: You were really brave!  You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.
Michael: It's true.
Christian: You said 'World, this is my blood!  It's red, just like yours.  So love me!'


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #750]

Christian: Right down the street?
Michael: Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
Christian: I know.
Michael: It's bad.
Christian: It's terrible.
Michael: It, you know what, it really is.
Jan: Uh- 
Christian: I don't know.  I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts.
Michael: Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?


[Date: November 8, 2005, Session #751]

Michael:   See ya.
Jan: Bye... thanks.  Yes!
Michael: We did it!
Jan: We got it!
Michael: Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.
Jan: I am really-  Thrilled.  Let's go.
Michael: What!?
Jan: Let's go.
Michael: Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go.  Oh-ok.


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #752]

Michael: Morning, Pam.  Hey.


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #753]

Michael: No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I'm, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all.  It's off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #754]

Michael: Hello, Dwight.
Dwight: Did you do her?
Michael: Who.
Dwight: Jan Levinson-Gould.
Michael: Uh, no, no, no Gould.
Dwight: Did you do her?
Michael: This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
Dwight: And she is your boss.
Michael: And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.   Jan, I defend your honor.    Is that all?


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #755]

Michael: I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question: do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I don't know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  It's, uh,  Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  How's traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No.   Would you excuse me?  No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no.  This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk  Excuse me?  Excuse me?!   I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didn't slip you something!


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #756]

Michael: Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
Pam: Hmm...
Michael: Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet.  It's, it's kind of unique.  It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.  And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers  and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg  I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.  The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #757]

Kevin: Most of that is good.
Michael:  Not today, Kevin.  Cannot be around carbs today.  You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #758]

Jan: I'm almost there, so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation.
Michael: Uh huh.
Jan: And, uh, hmm, excuse me, I've also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at four p.m.
Michael: Conflict!
Jan: What?
Michael: I have a conflict with that.
Jan: What do you mean?
Michael: Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies.
Jan: Michael.  I need you to take this seriously.
Michael: I can't get out of it!
Jan: Michael-
Michael: Ok, alright.
Jan: Are you hearing me?
Michael: I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed.
Jan: This is a very important-
Michael: Meeting confirmed.  Would you like your confirmation number?  Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.
Jan:  I'll see you in ten minutes.
Michael: 42897.  Ok.


[Date: November 9, 2005, Session #759]

Michael: What is a closer?  A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done.  And that is me.  A B C, always be closing.  Glen Garry, Glen Ross.  'Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.'  'No way, they're just for closers.'  'Do you know who you're talking to?' 'I'm Michael Scott.'  'Really?  Well, take any lead you want.'  'No thanks, I don't need 'em.'  Because I have a client list  right here in my computer.   So suck on that.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #760]

Michael: Pam, could I see you in my office?


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #761]

Michael: Pam, you're trustworthy-
Pam: Thank you.
Michael: And a woman-
Pam: Oh, no.
Michael: And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions?
Pam: Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #762]

Michael: My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #763]

Michael:  'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
Pam: She missed you.
Michael: But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
Pam: I have one idea of what it means.
Michael: Ok. Yeah, what, what?
Pam: Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
Michael: Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review-
Pam: Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
Michael: Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
Pam: Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
Michael: Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let's listen to that again.  'Michael, it's Jan.  I guess I missed you'.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #764]

Stanley: Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
Michael: Really?
Stanley: Oh, yes.  Let's listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.
Michael: God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
Stanley: Oh, no, that's ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.
Michael: No kidding.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #765]

Michael: Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #766]

Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: Jan's on the phone for you.
Michael: Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #767]

Michael: Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.  Yeah?
Jan: Michael.
Michael: Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
Jan: I am returning your many calls.
Michael: Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
Jan: No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
Michael: Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
Jan: Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
Michael: Oh.
Jan: I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
Michael: Been thinking about you.
Jan: Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
Michael: Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
Jan: Michael.
Michael: Yep.
Jan: Are the cameras with you...
Michael: No.
Jan: ...in your office?
Michael: They are not.  Yes, they are.   That's my girlfriend.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #768]

Michael: Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?
Pam: Sorry.
Michael: That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.
Pam: What suggestion box?
Michael: The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?
Pam: Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
Michael: Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
Ryan: Don't you mean constructive criticism?
Michael: What did I say?
Kelly: You said 'constructive complements'; that doesn't make any sense.
Michael: Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #769]

Jan:   We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye.   Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
Pam: Sure.
Michael: Hi, Jan.  How are you?
Jan: I'm good; how are you?
Michael: Good to see you.
Jan: Nice to see you.
Michael: Ok.  Ok, why don't we just step into my office?  We're gonna go in here.
Jan: Can we please go in your office?
Michael: Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous.  No calls.
Kevin: Oooo.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #770]

Michael: Alright .
Jan: Thank you.
Michael: It's nice to see you.
Jan: Nice to see you too, Michael.
Michael: Really?
Jan: Not like that.
Michael: Oh, well.
Jan: You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
Michael: Alright.
Jan: Period.
Michael: Yep.
Jan: Do we understand each other.
Michael: Absolutely.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #771]

Michael: I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because 'Oh, I regret that.'  But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.'  But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.'  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #772]

Jan: So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
Michael: No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.    We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
Jan: No.
Michael: This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
Jan: Fine.
Michael: Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Jan: How is that a business question?
Michael: Well, you're wearing it at the office. And  it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
Jan: Please don't smell me, Michael.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #773]

Michael: I don't understand-  Hold on.  Sorry.   Yes, Pam.
Pam: Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
Michael: I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
Pam: You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Michael: I did not, not, not use those words.
Jan: Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting  is it happening right now?
Michael: No, it's in like ten minutes.
Pam: Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
Jan: Great.  Very good.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #774]

Michael: Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'
Dwight: What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Kelly: I thought you read these every week.
Michael: Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.
Dwight: It happens occasionally.
Michael: And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
Jan: That sounds serious, Michael.
Michael: Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
Dwight: Tom?
Michael: Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
Phyllis: Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.  Tom?  Pow.
Michael: Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
Dwight: Next suggestion.
Michael: Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'
Dwight: You need to do something about your B.O.
Michael: Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
Toby: Aren't the suggestions meant for you?
Michael: Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
Creed: Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
Michael: Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-
Dwight: You need-
Michael: Ok.
Dwight: To do something about-
Michael: Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
Angela: Sometimes you talk to us real close.
Michael: Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
Angela: Well, when you have coffee breath-
Michael: I'll work on that-
Angela: It's hard.
Michael: Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
Dwight: Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Michael: Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
Dwight: Next suggestion.
Michael: Don't sl-', ok, that's blank  Don't, just put it-
Dwight: Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #775]

Jan: I can't, I can't-
Michael: I don't understand why you're so upset.
Jan: Please sit down.
Michael: Let me ask you-
Jan: You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
Michael: Ok, let me ask you this.
Jan: Please, sit yourself down.
Michael: Let me ask you something.
Jan: What, Michael.
Michael: Where did you get your outfit?


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #776]

Michael: I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Jan: Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
Michael: Look-
Dwight: Michael?
Michael: Oh my God...
Dwight: I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
Jan: No, Dwight; come in.
Dwight: Great.
Michael: What do you want Dwight?
Dwight: I am ready for my performance review.
Michael: Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
Jan: Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
Michael: You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
Dwight: Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Michael: Why on earth would we give you a raise?
Dwight: That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication.  I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness.  Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
Michael: You do?  How do you get in?
Dwight: I have a copy of your key.
Jan: That's a serious offense!
Michael: That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
Jan: Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
Dwight: I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Michael: Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
Dwight: For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
Michael: That was deer!? Gross, oh!
Dwight: You liked it!
Michael: Oh, did not!
Dwight: Jan, have you ever had deer?
Jan: No.
Dwight: It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Michael: What do you say, Jan?
Jan: Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
Michael: Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
Jan:  Thank you, Dwight.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #777]

Dwight: And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
Michael: That's from Superman?
Dwight: Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #778]

Jan: I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
Michael: Wait.
Jan: K?
Michael: Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
Jan: Michael, now is not the time or the place.
Michael: Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
Jan: No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
Michael: Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
Jan: Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
Michael: I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
Jan: Michael, it has nothing-
Michael: Am I too short?
Jan: With your looks, ok?  It's your personality.  I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
Michael: Really?
Jan: Really.  You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
Michael: I appreciate that, thank you.
Jan: And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
Michael: No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
Jan: At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
Michael: So my looks have nothing to do with it?
Jan: Ohhh, God.


[Date: November 15, 2005, Session #779]

Michael: Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #780]

Michael: Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?
Jim: Ummm... no idea.
Michael: Never missed a day, my ass.
Pam:  Thank you.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #781]

Michael: Oscar, I'm ready for you.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #782]

Michael: So...
Oscar: Michael, I don't know what to say.
Michael: Um, you're in accounting...
Oscar: Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
Michael: So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.
Oscar: Yes.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #783]

Jan: I am not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.
Michael: All right.
Jan: Period.
Michael: Yup.
Jan: Do we understand each other?
Michael: Absolutely.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #784]

Michael: I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #785]

Jim: So, that's... It's great.
Michael: Yes, it is.
Jim: Yeah. You have fun?
Michael: Yes, I did.
Jim: Did you go to first base?
Michael: Hell, yeah.
Jim: Oh, yeah?
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: Did you go to second?
Michael: What?
Jim: Second.
Michael: Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...
Jim: Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?
Michael: Um, yup, wait, yes.
Jim: Pop-up?
Michael: No, there... Later there was.
Jim: Really?
Michael: Yes.
Jim: So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I'm saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn't he?
Michael: I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing.
Jim: Office romances. Um...  I think you should probably ask Pam 'cause she's in an office romance, technically.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #786]

Michael: Let's just push on, shall we?
Dwight: Pushing on.
Michael: It's next. Just keep it. 'Look on the supply shelf.' What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
Ryan: Yeah. It's another note.
Michael: Okay, yeah.
Ryan: Look on the windshield.'
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Does it specify which windshield?
Ryan: I'll check them all.
Dwight: This ought to be good.
Jim: Which one?
Dwight: Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata.
Pam: He sees it.
Dwight: What does it say?
Jim: He can't hear you?
Michael: Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?
Dwight:  Come on. Let's get back to this.
Michael: All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?
Stanley: I'm back.
Michael: Christ Almighty.
Ryan: Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Michael: All right, next suggestion.
Dwight: Next suggestion.
Michael: Don't...' Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...
Dwight: Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Jan: Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.
Michael: Well...
Jan: The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?
Michael: Crystal.
Dwight: There's one more suggestion.
Michael: How pleasant. You can...
Dwight: Way to go man, Jan's really hot.'
Michael: Okay, I think we're good.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #787]

Michael: Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #788]

Michael: Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #789]

Michael: Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #790]

Michael: Never...
Jan: Never for me always means never, ever, ever.
Michael: Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding.
Jan: What?
Michael: Nothing, I just...
Jan: What did you say, Michael?
Michael: Nothing.
Jan: Did you call my ex?
Michael: No, I did not.
Jan: Gould, you said, Gould.
Michael: Maybe I did. Maybe I  called him, I don't know.
Jan: How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.
Michael: I...
Jan: Okay, how dare you do that?
Michael: I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.
Jan: Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?
Michael: Ex-husband, you have to let it go.
Jan: I mean...


[Date: November 16, 2005, Session #791]

Michael: What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.

[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #792]

Michael: It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.   Oh my God. Ohhh.  Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here.  Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend you're not here.
Jim: Are we in danger?
Michael: There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. 
Kevin: Michael, should I call the...  What?


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #793]

Michael: The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #794]

Michael: Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
Sadiq (IT guy): That just means you have to enter your password.
Michael: Oh...
Sadiq (IT guy): What's your password, Michael?
Michael: Oh, umm... 
Sadiq (IT guy): Oh, it's 1-2-3.
Michael: Yes.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #795]

Dwight: Mi-
Michael: AH! Guh-oood.
Dwight: Sorry.
Michael: Please don't do that.
Dwight: Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Michael: I can't tell you.
Dwight: You have to tell me.
Michael: I don't have to tell you anything.
Dwight: Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Michael: Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this.  Brrr!  That's strong!
Dwight: Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Michael: I'm not going get a brain-
Dwight: Or get hit by a car-
Michael: Stop it.
Dwight: Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Michael: Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away?


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #796]

Michael: There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #797]

Michael: So how do you search?
Sadiq (IT guy): By keyword phrase.
Michael: Try 'profits'.  No! Try 'Michael Scott'.  'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'.  Oh my God, wow!    E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.    'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.'  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #798]

Oscar: Hey, what's the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?
Michael: Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot?   I will destroy everything in my path-
Oscar: Actually, it's just-
Michael: Beep! Bop!
Oscar: Ok...
Michael: Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.   Oil can. Oil can.
Oscar: Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Michael: Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
Dwight: So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
Michael: You know what the problem is?
Stanley: I think I do.
Michael: The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #799]

Michael: Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim's tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... . No.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #800]

Michael: There's always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature's rule.  It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #801]

Kevin: That's pretty young.
Pam: Yeah.
Kevin:   Are you gonna eat with us?
Michael: Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
Jim: Uh hum.
Michael: Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
Pam: The professors would go to the parties?
Michael: Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #802]

Jim: So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
Pam: Really? That's great.
Jim: I know.
Pam: Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Jim:  Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Pam: Oh, no, he can't make it.
Jim: Oh, ok, cool.
Michael: Hey there.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Almost quittin' time.
Jim: Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
Michael: One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
Jim: Oh, um... .I can't.
Michael: You have plans.
Jim: Uh hmm, definitely.
Michael: I do, too. I do, too.
Jim: You do?
Michael: I do, yeah. Big plans.
Jim: Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-
Michael: Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
Jim: Really?
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Michael: It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
Jim: Improv sounds great.
Michael: It is. Ok.
Jim: Alright.
Michael:  What?
Jim: I think Stanley just coughed.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #803]

Michael: Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
Pam: No thanks.
Michael: Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-

Kevin: My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Michael: Ok, alright.
Kevin: Oh.

Angela: I'm just leaving for the day.
Michael: Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
Angela: Charity.  Bake drive.
Michael: Liar!
Angela: No!
Michael: You are a liar.
Angela: No, I'm not.
Michael: Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin' tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
Dwight: Battlestar Galatica.
Michael: That's, whatever stupid show you want-
Dwight: I can't-
Michael: To watch tonight
Dwight: Tonight.
Michael: We're watching it.
Dwight: Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
Michael: I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
Dwight: Clarinet.
Michael: You, too, Dwight?
Dwight: Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday.   He has no idea!

[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #805]

Michael: Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun.   That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't.


[Date: November 22, 2005, Session #806]

Girl acting Pregnant: I'm supposed to meet my doctor here?  Have ya seen him?  He's a very angry midget.

Improv Teacher: Ok, what about the scene they set up?
Michael: Boring.
Improv Teacher: No, it wasn't.  No more guns.

Bill: Oh, don't worry.  We're all gonna carpool.
Michael: So Bernie's, huh?  We're all going to Bernie's?   Go to Bernie's?

Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
Michael and Jim:  It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation.  Divided, together, uh huh.  Making love with each other, uh huh.
Michael: We're making love!
Michael and Jim:  Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong?  Sail away with me...


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #811]

Michael: Talk! Just talk!
Mary-Beth: I am-
Michael: Shut up!


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #812]

Michael: Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says 'Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.'   And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #813]

Sadiq (IT guy): Do you have a question or something?
Michael: Um...
Sadiq (IT guy): About my turban, maybe?
Michael: Nope, nope.  I actually wear a turban sometimes.  Wanna see it?
Sadiq (IT guy): Yeah.
Michael: Got it right here. 
Sadiq (IT guy): Why do you have that?
Michael: Comedy; it's funny.  It's Johnny Carson, Karnak.  It's, um, put it back.  Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land?
Sadiq (IT guy): In Pittsburgh?  Yeah, but I never really watched him.
Michael: Oh. You were forbidden.
Sadiq (IT guy): No, I'm much younger than you.  I watched Conan.
Michael: Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee.  Do you want some coffee er-
Sadiq (IT guy): No.
Michael: Or some tea or hummus or something?
Sadiq (IT guy): No, thank you.


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #814]

Michael: Should have done this a long time ago.  Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.  Uh, uh huh.  Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton?  Poor Richard's number seven?  Idiot.  Stupid load.    Yeah.
Pam: Hey, Michael, accounting needs your approval on-
Michael: Yeah, I'm busy right now. 


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #815]

Michael: Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim.  Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
Jim: Yeah, definitely didn't need help with that, but, yeah.
Michael: It's seems like ya did though-
Jim: Oh?
Michael: Jim.  Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space.  Alright, let's get back to work.


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #816]

Michael:  Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
Dwight: Where's your tie?
Michael: I don't know.  Just felt like taking it off.  Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim?
Jim: Uh, yeah, I guess.
Dwight: What's going on, Michael.  Talk to me.
Michael: I don't know, same old stuff.  Same old.  Boss just been ridin' my ass.
Dwight: Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on?
Michael: I don't wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
Dwight: The most important one of the guys.
Michael: That's not the point.
Dwight: That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: Where you come from, and who you are.
Michael: Ok.
Dwight: You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Michael: Ok yes, I would never do that.
Jim: Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.
Michael: Ha.
Dwight: Jim, this is hardly the time.
Michael: No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.  This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out.  Enjoying friends, all being the same.  Worker bees.
Dwight: And their king bee.
Michael: No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
Dwight: Master bee.
Michael: I'm not a master bee.
Dwight: Queen bee.
Michael: I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.

Michael: Five o'clock.  Time to go get my improv on.   Little bit of the comedy juice.  Mmm.  Alright, see if you can guess what this is.   That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.  Just a taste of the improv.


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #818]

Michael: I need to know... who shot Johnson!
Mary-Beth: Uh, President Johnson.  Um-
Michael: Shut up!
Mary-Beth: Ok.
Michael: I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
Mary-Beth: I, I killed him. You're right! It was me!
Michael: Just shut up!  I don't wanna hear anything more from you.
Improv Teacher: No, listen to what she's saying.
Mary-Beth: Alright, I'll be quiet if we can make some kind of deal.  A deal?
Michael: Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn't make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. 
Improv Teacher: Good, good.
Michael: She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
Mary-Beth: I don't think... he was saying-
Michael: Well, you kept-
Mary-Beth: He kept saying 'shut up'-
Michael: Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going.
Mary-Beth: I-
Bill: It goes wherever.
Michael: Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
Mary-Beth: I felt like he was ordering me around, cause he-
Michael: Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone-
Improv Teacher: All your characters order people around though, and-
Michael: Well...
Improv Teacher: There's stronger choices.
Michael: I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
Mary-Beth: We've seen you do that character before though.  I mean, you know, that's cool.
Michael: Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's...
Mary-Beth: Like Jim Carrey or something.
Michael: Exactly, thank you.
Mary-Beth: Right, well I wasn't saying that-
Michael: I appreciate that.
Mary-Beth: Nah, I know, I just meant that... he shot me, I just-
Michael: Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.
Mary-Beth: Yeah, ya know maybe, he made me get on the ground, and I didn't feel safe in this game.
Michael: You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn.  That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment.
Improv Teacher: You succeeded.
Michael: Good work.
Mary-Beth: Yeah.


[Date: November 23, 2005, Session #819]

Improv Teacher: Ok, for the next exercise, let's everyone pair up. And everyone got somebody?  Ok, good.  Uh, ok, uh, why don't you go out in the hallway and go through all the rules in your head.  Ok, you take a break and sort of run through the rules in your head.  Ok, stay there.
Michael: I'll just throw out some suggestions.
Improv Teacher: Ok, you guys wanna start?   Don't throw out any-
Michael: They're in a whorehouse.
Improv Teacher: Suggestions.
Michael: And he's a proctologist.  What?
Improv Teacher: We don't need a suggestion for this one; it's gonna come from them.  It's a game called 'Yes, and?' and uh, you will say the first sentence.  And uh, you're telling a story-
Michael: First sentence is: 'I'm a proctologist'.
Improv Teacher: We're not gonna get a suggestion for this one, it's gonna come from them.  Ok, you're gonna say the first sentence and then she will say yes to that and then she'll add something to the story, like you're telling a story.   Oh yeah, what was he doing?  Ok, why don't you take a break?  Since you don't have a partner.
Michael: Alright, I'm ready here.
Improv Teacher: Ok.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #820]

Michael:  Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  'Tis the ... ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
Pam: Can I help you, Michael?
Michael: I'm looking for the toy drive box.
Pam: It's behind you.
Michael: OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
Jim: Wow. What kind of bike is that?
Michael: Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
Kevin: The tires look pretty worn.
Michael: Well, that is probably from the test drive.
Jim: But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Michael: No.
Andy: Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
Michael: Oh, thanks. 
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
Pam:  I didn't, it's from corporate.
Michael: OK. Did everybody get one of these?
Pam: Yup.
Michael: Terrific. Good.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #821]

Michael: This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #822]

Jim:   Carol.
Carol: Hi, is Michael around here?
Michael: There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. 
Carol: Michael.
Michael: Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
Carol:  What?
Michael: Turn around, turn around. Come on. 
Carol: Get outta here.
Michael: No, you get outta here.
Andy: Michael
Michael: Yes.
Andy: If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
Dwight:  Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Michael: Thank you.
Carol: I really need a moment alone with you. 
Michael: Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #823]

Carol: What is this? 
Michael: That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
Carol: No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
Michael: I know.
Carol: I went on a ski trip.
Michael: Right.
Carol: Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
Michael: Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
Carol: Michael.
Michael: And next to your kids. What?
Carol: This is so weird.
Michael: I don't understand?


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #824]

Carol: I think you're a really sweet guy.
Michael: OK
Carol: But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
Michael: No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
Carol: What are you talking about?
Michael: I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
Carol: Oh, no. Michael.
Michael: And it's all inclusive.
Carol: Michael...
Michael: Yes.
Carol: I'm sorry.
Michael: No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
Carol: I know. 


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #825]

Michael: I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
Stanley: You can't cancel a holiday.
Michael: Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
Stanley: What does that mean?
Michael: Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
Pam: Michael, what's going on?
Michael: Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
Jim: Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
Kevin: That's not fair.
Dwight:  Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Michael: Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
Phyllis: But we invited guests.
Michael: Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #826]

Michael: Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
Pam: I know.
Michael: It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
Pam: OK, well, why are you laying like that?
Michael:  Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
Pam: Like what?
Michael: Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
Pam: Well.. um I, I don't...
Michael: And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
Pam: I don't need to know.
Dwight: Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
Michael: Take it from Toby.
Dwight: Copy.
Michael: Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
Pam: No, thank you.
Michael: It's all...  OK.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #827]

Michael: What are you doing? 
Dwight:  We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Andy: Hey, what's the haps? 
Michael: Carol?
Dwight: Oh, look at this.  Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. 
Dwight: Why don't you just buy the whole song?
Michael: I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
Dwight: Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem.  But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
Michael:  Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. 


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #828]

Michael: This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #829]

Andy: Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch.  C'mon, my treat.
Michael: All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
Andy: That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
Michael: Hooters?
Andy: No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. 
Michael: Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
Ryan: Ah man, I can't.
Michael: Why not?
Ryan: I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. 
Michael: Ok, feel better.
Ryan: Thanks.
Michael: C'mon Jim, let's go.
Jim: OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
Ryan: Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #830]

Michael: Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #831]

Andy: So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.'  Thank you. Michael  Head of the table.
Dwight: Get out Jim.  Actually, um...  Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
Michael: Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
Andy: So she looks at me right, and she goes, 'I'm sorry, don't I even know you?' After a year, a
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
Michael: Carol used to drink lattes.
Dwight:  What're you talking about?
Michael: She would get this little foam mustache...
Dwight:  Carol had a mustache?
Michael: And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny.
Dwight:  What are you guys talking about?
Michael: She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
Dwight: Michael! Repeat what you said louder!


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #832]

Michael: I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
Andy: No.
Dwight: Who are you calling?
Michael: I'm just gonna call her.
Andy: Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here,  we need your help.
Waitress: What can I get for 'ya?
Andy: I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. 


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #833]

Michael: Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
Andy: Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
Cindy: I don't know.
Michael: Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. 
Andy: You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us.  Watch, watch, watch, watch.  Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
Michael: You're right. That's good.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #834]

Angela:  I need to know if I can start the party?
Dwight: Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! 
Andy: This drink... 
Michael: I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Angela: Did Michael give you permission to do this?
Dwight:  Start the party.
Angela:  Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now 
Pam: Our party is also starting now 
Karen: Yup.
Karen:  All right Stanley. Woo.
Pam: Good choice. 
Angela: Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
Hannah: Why would I be disappointed?
Angela: I said you wouldn't be disappointed. 
Angela: Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
Meredith: Is that a threat?
Angela: No, it's an invitation.
Pam: We have vodka!
Karen: Lots of it! 


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #835]

Michael: Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak.
Man: Excuse me.
Michael: Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style.
Jim: No, it's not.
Andy: Cindy, Cindy.
Michael: I don't think... I love it!
Andy: I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house.  C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
Michael:  I don't know what he's doing.
Andy: This is great.
Dwight: Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
Jim: Oh,  she's asleep.
Dwight: Oh... Narcolepsy.
Jim: Probably.
Andy: Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
Cindy: I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft...
Dwight: Oh my gosh, now she's up.
Jim: And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
Dwight: Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood.  Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #836]

Andy:  They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
Michael: You know what we should do?
Andy: What?
Michael: We should invite them to the Christmas party.
Andy: Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
Michael: Oh, you are such mench my friend. 


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #837]

Michael: OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. 
Jim: I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #838]

Michael: The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
Second Cindy: That rocks.
Michael: Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.
Second Cindy: Thanks! I, I wanna give you something.
Michael: Oh.  That's what she said.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #839]

Michael: Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
Andy: My new girlfriend.
Angela: Where's Dwight?
Second Cindy: Is he the hot one or the giant baby?
Michael:  The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
Phyllis:  There's another party in the break room.
Michael: Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
Angela: Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? 
Second Cindy: I thought I could have it.
Angela: You can't have it  I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
Michael: Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
Dwight: Hey! It's Angela!  Hey!
Michael: We're going to ...


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #840]

Michael: I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos.  And... my question to you  is do you agree?
Other waitress: Do I agree about what?
Michael: Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute.
Other waitress: What're you talking about?
Michael: What're you talking about?


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #841]

Andy and Michael:  And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland.  Your body is a wonderland.
Andy: Your hands.
Both: Your body is a wonderland.
Andy: I'll use my hands on it.
Both: Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face...


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #842]

Kelly:  Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
Michael: When you know, you just know.
Kevin: Right.
Michael: Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Roy: Which one is she? 
Michael: It's... it's one of those two. 
Roy: You don't know?
Kevin: Dude, you should know.
Michael: Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #843]

Michael: I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #844]

Michael: Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
Second Cindy: You know where I am.
Michael: Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile 
Second Cindy: Oh.
Michael: Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #845]

Second Cindy: Hey.
Michael: Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
Second Cindy: Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave.
Michael: No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
Second Cindy: Cool...
Michael: Where do you wanna go?
Second Cindy: I... We're just gonna take off.
Michael: I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
Second Cindy: No... I have school. 
Michael: You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
Second Cindy: Merry Christmas.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #846]

Michael: That waitress was the one.
Jim: No. She wasn't.
Michael: How can you be sure?
Jim: Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago.
Michael: Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
Jim: Sorry.
Michael: I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
Jim: You what?
Michael: I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Oh, why do I feel like crap?
Jim: You just had a rebound.
Michael: I had rebound? Yeah.
Jim: Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #847]

Michael: I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #848]

Michael:  Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #849]

Michael: William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #850]

Michael: No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.
Jim: So, really, you're just calling her?
Michael: Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.
Dwight:  Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #851]

Michael:  No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did


[Date: December 23, 2006, Session #852]

Michael: Oh, honey, here's Stanley.
Second Cindy: Hi.
Michael: He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
Stanley: Oh, you're gonna face far greater problems than I can possibly help you with.
Michael: Sounds good. Okay, let's go.

[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #853]

Michael: Hey, mon!
Pam: Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...  that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
Michael: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Pam: OK.
Michael: Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
Pam: It's kind of serious.
Michael: Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
Pam: How was Jamaica?
Michael: It was
Stanley: Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
Michael: Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
Stanley: My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
Michael: OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Stanley: They said I should talk to you.
Michael: Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...
Stanley: I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
Michael: You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #854]

Michael: Feelin' hot, hot, hot!  Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.
Pam: That's good. 
Michael: You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
Pam: Huh.
Michael: Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
Pam: It's kind of an impoverished country.
Michael: Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
Pam: But you can't today, we're doing inventory.
Michael: Inventory's at the end of December.
Pam: We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
Michael: I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #855]

Michael: Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #856]

Michael: Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
Angela: By the end of the day? That's impossible.
Michael: The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.'
Jim: Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'
Angela: Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #857]

Michael: How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #858]

Michael: Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign?  'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
Pam: Oh my God. Is that Jan? 
Everybody: What? Where?
Pam: On the left.
Everybody: Oh yeah, oh my God.
Michael: No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #859]

Michael: Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #860]

Michael:  Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Packer: Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
Michael: Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
Packer: You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
Michael: Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
Packer: They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
Michael: Oh no?
Packer: No.
Michael: OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
Packer: Well, no. I got nothing.
Michael: Check it again. Hit refresh.
Packer: Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
Michael: OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at...  Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
Packer: Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #861]

Michael: Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
Roy: He's in the office.
Michael: OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
Darryl: All right, what's up Mike?
Michael: That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
Darryl: Yup.
Michael: OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
Darryl: Uh huh.
Michael: OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
Darryl: Yup.
Michael: And you sent that out to everyone?
Darryl: Mike, I'm very busy down here. 


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #862]

Michael: I have a special assignment for you.
Dwight: Who's the target?
Michael: A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'
Dwight: What's it of?
Michael: Not important.
Dwight: Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
Michael: OK, forget it.
Dwight: OK, I accept it.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #863]

Toby: Hey I need to talk to you right now.
Michael: Not now, not ever.
Toby: About you and Jan.
Michael: Aww, none of your business.
Toby: Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
Michael: That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
Toby: Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
Michael: This is probably the icebreaker you need.
Toby: You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
Michael: I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
Toby: All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
Michael: No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
Toby: All right, thanks Michael.
Michael: OK.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #864]

Pam:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
Michael: Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
Pam: He'll call you back. OK, great.
Michael: She bought it?  OK. OK.
Dwight:  Michael hit a deer?


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #865]

Dwight: Michael! Michael!  There's an emergency in the warehouse.
Michael: There an accident? Somebody hurt?
Dwight: No, it's... involves the photograph.
Michael: Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #866]

Roy:  Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
Michael: All right. 
Roy: That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #867]

Michael: Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
Kevin: Jan.
Michael: No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
Jim: Urkel Grue.
Michael: My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #868]

Michael: Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! 
Pam: Hey.
Michael: Hey.
Pam: What are you doing out here?
Michael: Island living. You know?
Pam: Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
Michael: Did she say what it's about?
Pam: That's all she said.
Andy: Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot 


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #869]

Dwight: I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Michael: There are copies in the bathroom?
Dwight: There were. A lot of them.
Michael: All right.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #870]

Jan: Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
Michael: Guh.
Kevin: Hi Jan, you look... tan.
Jan: I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
Kevin: Yeah. How was it?
Jan: Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
Michael: OK, yup.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #871]

Jan: Why am I here, Michael?
Michael: I...
Jan: In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
Michael: I... I... Yes.
Jan: I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
Michael: OK, yeah.
Jan: This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
Michael: Who is Dr. Perry? I...
Jan: This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
Michael: And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
Jan: Good, good.
Michael: So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
Jan: Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
Michael: Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - 
Jan: Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
Michael: Jan, you... complete... me.
Jan: Oh, God.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #872]

Michael: I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #873]

Michael: Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH!  So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #874]

Dwight: Hello, you're back.
Michael: Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.
Dwight: While you were gone...
Michael: Me had an i-rey time.
Dwight: While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
Michael: Dwight, please, please.
Dwight: He turned over my...
Michael: I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #875]

Michael: Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.
Dwight: Unbelievable.
Michael: Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.
Andy: I give thanks, mon.
Michael: You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. 
Angela: No, I didn't.
Michael: Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.
Pam: That's okay.
Michael: I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!
Pam: No.
Michael:  Try it on.
Pam: No.
Michael: Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
Pam: Thank you.
Michael: Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #876]

Michael: I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man.  Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #877]

Michael: Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon?  No one.
Kevin: But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
Michael: His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #878]

Michael: I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #879]

Michael: How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?
Jim:  Are you stoned?
Michael: I...
Jim: In the picture, are you high?
Michael: Oh, that's red eye.
Jim: Is that not what happens when you're high?
Kevin: You look like you have the munchies.
Michael: Well...
Kelly: I have the munchies. I'm gonna get some of those chocolate wafers.
Michael: Hey, can we just focus?


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #880]

Dwight: Come on. Come on.
Michael: Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.
Dwight: Try Dwight.
Michael: Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #881]

Michael: Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #882]

Michael:  Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please.
Kelly: Eighty-six. Eighty-seven.  Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.


[Date: January 4, 2007, Session #883]

Michael: Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. 
Stanley: There is a butterfly on this. Why?
Michael: It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.
Stanley: So it's either worth $15 bucks or $65,000.
Michael: Yes, good luck with that.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #884]

Michael: Jim, could you come in here please?
Harvey: Hi, Jim.
Jim: Hello.
Harvey: I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks.
Michael: Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.
Jim: Yeah, you can.
Michael: You know what? Get Pam.
Jim: For this?
Michael: Pam.
Harvey: Pam, you look very hot today.
Jim: Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
Pam: Great.
Harvey: Me so horny. Me love you long tim.
Michael: Oh, that is gross.
Pam: Who is 'Long Tim'?
Michael: Damn it.
Harvey: Long time. Me lobe yoy long time.
Jim: Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
Pam: I would love to meet Long Tim.
Jim: Yeah. Right?
Pam: Yeah.
Harvey: You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.
Jim: Ok.
Pam: Ok. Bye Harvey.
Harvey: Boobs.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #885]

Michael: Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
Andy: Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
Michael: Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
Andy: Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
Michael: Oh.
Andy: Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
Michael: Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Andy: Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
Michael: Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
Phyllis: We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
Karen: Oh, uh, thanks.
Michael: Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
Stanley: Pass.
Michael: You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
Stanley: ... I'll take the kid.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #886]

Michael: So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
Dwight: Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
Jim: Yup. I'll trade.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #887]

Andy: Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
Michael: Dwight?
Dwight: Yup?
Michael: Here ya go. 
Dwight: Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
Michael: Please.
Andy: He does your laundry?
Michael: Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the 'Amazing Race.'  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
Karen: Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
Michael: No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
Ryan: Is there a prize?
Michael: Just bragging rights.
Phyllis: Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?
Michael: It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
Dwight: Come on!!
Phyllis: Michael. 
Michael: Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
Andy: Bueno.
Phyllis: Do you have a pole?
Karen: Let's go get a broom.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #888]

Michael: Here we go.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #889]

Andy: What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
Michael: Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
Andy: Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #890]

Andy: I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
Michael: Hawkman.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #891]

Andy: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
Michael:  Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #892]

Michael: Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
Buyer: Yep.
Michael: You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
Andy: Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
Michael: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
Andy: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
Buyer: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.
Michael: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
Andy: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
Michael: No.
Andy: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
Michael: Stop it.  Stop it.
Andy: Ow.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #893]

Andy: Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
Michael: Yes.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #894]

Andy: I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
Michael: Ah, no. Don't worry about it.
Andy: I really 'Schruted' it.
Michael: What?
Andy: Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
Michael: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #895]

Andy: Hey boss. Got a minute?
Michael: Yes, Andy.
Andy: I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
Michael: He didn't say.
Andy: That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
Michael: No, you are remembering it wrong.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #896]

Michael: Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #897]

Jan: Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote 'Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.'
Michael: I knew it. 
Andy: Oh, doggie.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #898]

Dwight: Hey, we nailed the sale!
Michael: Where were you this morning?
Dwight: I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
Michael: Why do you lie, liar?
Dwight: I am not a liar.
Michael: You are lying right now.
Andy: It sure seems like he is lying.
Dwight: Stay out of this, you!
Michael: I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
Dwight: Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
Michael: Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
Dwight: That's what she said.
Michael: Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.


[Date: January 11, 2007, Session #899]

Dwight: I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Michael: Good luck.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #900]

Michael: Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Andy: The cost of doing business.
Michael: Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
Andy: Was the top salesman...
Michael: I said 'was'.
Andy:  Addition by subtraction.
Michael: What does that even mean? That is impossible.
Andy: Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
Michael: But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #901]

Andy: Hey, boss.
Michael: Hey, what's up.
Andy: Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
Michael: Yep.
Andy: Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my 'Lost' on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
Michael: I don't know. Maybe.
Andy: Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going?
Michael: Bathroom.
Andy: Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #902]

Michael: Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Pam: Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
Michael: Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Pam: Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
Michael: Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
Andy: Feel ya, dawg.
Michael: Yeah, do you?
Andy: Absolutely.
Michael: What did I say?
Andy: You said... 
Michael: Huh.
Andy: Which is like, 'Right on.' And Pam was like 'blah blah blah' and you were like 'Yeah, psht.' Nailed it.
Michael: Oh, no.
Andy: Oh, no.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #903]

MIchael: Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for 'being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me.' I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #904]

Oscar: I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
Michael: No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
Oscar: Michael --
Michael: No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
Oscar: Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Michael: Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #905]

Michael: Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #906]

Michael: Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Phyllis: Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
Michael: Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
Stanley: Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
Michael: Really?
Stanley: No.
Michael: Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
Phyllis: No. Sorry.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #907]

Michael: Nice to have Oscar back.
Angela: Yeah.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #908]

Angela: I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
Michael: Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Angela: Yes.
Michael: Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Angela: None of them. Especially not Andy.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #909]

Michael: Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
Andy: Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
Michael: Um.
Andy: Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
Michael: No. I don't want to do any of that.
Andy: Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
Michael: No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
Andy: Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD.  That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
Pam: Yeah.
Andy: Sure? Okay.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #910]

Dwight:  Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Michael: Hey.
Dwight: Hey.
Michael: What's up?
Dwight: Same old.
Michael: Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Dwight: Oh my God, she told you?
Michael: Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
Dwight: Accepted.
Michael: How's this place treating you?
Dwight:  The boss isn't funny.
Michael: Oh, well.
Dwight: I don't get to wear my ties.
Michael: No. I'm sure.
Dwight: So?
Michael: So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
Dwight: I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Michael: We can talk about that.  All right.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #911]

Angela: Are you enjoying your fiesta?
Oscar: Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out --  it's great.
Michael: Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Everybody: Yay. 
Angela: Welcome back.
Dwight: Thank you.
Michael: Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
Dwight: You did this for me? 
Michael: Guilty.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #912]

Michael: Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
Pam: No, I will not.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #913]

Michael: So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
Oscar: It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Michael: Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #914]

Michael: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? 
Dwight: Oh, man.  No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! 


[Date: January 28, 2007, Session #915]

Michael: It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #916]

Michael: Hello son.  If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead.  Life is a road---
Dwight: How do you know it's going to be a boy?
Michael: How, would you stop interrupting please?


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #917]

Michael: Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #918]

Michael: Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #919]

Michael: To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
Dwight: 


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #920]

Michael: Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
Pam: What?
Michael: We will demonstrate on Pam.
Pam: No.  No. 
Michael: Come on.


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #921]

Michael:  You just twist your hand until something breaks.
Dwight: Ow.
Michael: Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.


[Date: February 1, 2007, Session #922]

Michael: And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
Dwight: What if he's a murderer?
Michael: He's not going to be a murderer.
Dwight: Maybe that's how you die.
Michael: You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
Dwight: I want to do this.
Michael: Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
Dwight: Action.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #923]

Michael: Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.   So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one.  This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #924]

Michael: I'm sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #925]

Michael: I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that's for sure.  It'll probably be on a boat.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #926]

Michael: What's up spinsters?
Angela: Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.
Michael: No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #927]

Packer: Halpert!  Tall, queer, handsome as ever.  Hey everybody it's me, Jim.  Hello, hello.  Todd Packer.
Karen: Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend.
Packer: Shut up!
Karen: Yep.
Packer: Shut it!
Karen: That's rude.
Packer: Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
Michael: Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! 
Packer: What happened?
Michael: Oh God-
Packer: Quick somebody help!  Help the man! 
Michael: No, no, no!


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #928]

Michael: I can't believe you're not going to be there.  It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man.
Packer: I have a full day of sales calls.
Michael: You should get out of them.
Packer: 
Michael: It's the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It's going to be great.  We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
Packer: And what kind of stripper did you get?
Michael: I did not order a stripper.
Packer: You didn't order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
Michael: Um, not personally, no.
Packer: Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101.  If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.
Michael: I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
Packer: Just get one for the girls too.  That evens it out.  You know, separate but equal.
Michael: So that's what that means.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #929]

Michael: Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! 
Dwight: Alright! Uh! 
Michael: Gay.
Dwight: What?
Michael: Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
Angela: Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
Meredith: SHUT UP ANGELA!


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #930]

Michael: Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
Jim: Absolutely not.
Dwight: I'm on it.
Michael: Well get on it.  And make it happen.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #931]

Michael: 
Ryan: He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
Michael:  Gotcha, oh!  Yes?
Jim: Are you okay?
Michael: I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop.
Jim: Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
Michael: Squarepants?
Jim: Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
Michael: And you think that'd be sexy?


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #932]

Ben Franklin: Hold the door please!
Michael: Oh.
Ben Franklin: Thank you.
Michael: Oh.  Hello!
Ben Franklin: Hello!
Michael: You wearing a thong?
Ben Franklin: What?


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #933]

Angela: Sparkling cider is very good.
Pam: I think that's champagne.
Angela: 
Michael: Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who's a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
Ben Franklin: Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin.
Michael: Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
Ben Franklin: Knickers in fact, yes!
Michael: He's in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
Ben Franklin: Well, actually, I never was president.
Michael: Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
Ben Franklin: Ah.  I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers.
Michael: And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
Meredith: Wait, this is the entertainment?
Michael: Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. 


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #934]

Michael: Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
Ryan: Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
Michael: No.  Yes.
Ryan: Oh gross.
Michael: But I got all the foot off of it.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #935]

Michael: Guys, beef!  It's what's for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
Dwight: I do!  I want some man meat!
Jim: Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
Michael: Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
Stanley:  Of course.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #936]

Kevin: Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Michael: I call shuffle.  Here we go.  
Kevin: Michael.
Michael: Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
Elizabeth: Hi guys!
Michael: Nice outfit.
Elizabeth: I hear there's an important meeting here.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #937]

Elizabeth: Hit it.  So where's the groom?
Michael: He's right there.  There he is.
Bob Vance: Absolutely not.  That's all you.  That's all you.
Michael: Okay.  Alright, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
Elizabeth: Just sit on down.
Michael: Alright.
Elizabeth: Alright.
Michael: Okay.
Elizabeth: Here we go.
Michael: Here we go.  Alright!
Elizabeth: Yeah!
Michael: Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
Elizabeth: Mmm, what's that?
Michael: You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
Elizabeth: I bet she'd be jealous. 
Michael: Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #938]

Michael: On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
Ben Franklin: You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.
Michael: Really.
Ben Franklin: But I kept all this from my wife Deborah.  These things only serve to upset the women.  They are the gentler sex.
Michael: Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #939]

Michael: Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
Elizabeth: Secrets, secrets are no fun.  Secrets, secrets hurt someone.
Michael: Wow.  Thank you.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #940]

Jan:  Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?
Michael: Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
Jan: Okay.
Michael: I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
Jan: Uh when, when did, when last night?
Michael: No, today at work.
Jan: You went to a bachelor party at work?
Michael: Yes. I kind of arranged it.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #941]

Michael: So you don't want to end our relationship?
Jan: I'm closer to firing you.
Michael: That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
Jan: I'll talk to you later.
Michael: You are.  You are.


[Date: February 2, 2007, Session #942]

Michael: So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #943]

Michael: Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
Photographer: Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #944]

Michael: Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #945]

Michael: There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
Phyllis: Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Michael: How you doin'? You excited.
Phyllis: Yes, very.
Michael: Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
Phyllis: No.
Michael: You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
Phyllis: That wasn't me.
Michael: Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
Phyllis: I thought it was...
Michael: Here, let me...
Phyllis: Michael... No.
Michael: Just cover up that bald patch.
Phyllis: I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #946]

Michael: You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
Michael:  I hate you!
Michael: Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #947]

Michael: This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #948]

Pam: That's my dress.
Michael:  That's ok. 
Dwight: It's a miracle.
Crowd: 
Michael: This is bull****!


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #949]

Michael: Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #950]

Michael: I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #951]

Priest: And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Phyllis: I do.
Michael: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
Priest: And do you, Bob...
Michael: Oh, shiii...
Priest: ... take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife
Bob Vance: I do.
Priest: You may now kiss the bride.
Michael: Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #952]

Michael: Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
Bob Vance: If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you.
Michael: Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #953]

Michael: Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
Phyllis: It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Michael: I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
Phyllis: It's fish.
Michael: I will take care of that.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #954]

Michael: I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #955]

Randy: Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler!
Crowd: 
Unknown: She is.
Randy: Cheers.
Crowd: Cheers.
Michael: Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #956]

Michael: The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #957]

Michael: Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
Bob Vance: Oh okay. That's enough.
Michael: is a guy that...
Bob Vance: Thanks, Michael. Give me...
Michael: he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
Bob Vance: Give me the microphone.
Michael: No. I'm not going to...
Bob Vance: Give me... Give me the microphone, Michael.
Michael: Ok. All right.
Bob Vance: You're out of here!
Michael: Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #958]

Michael: Come... Come on!
Dwight: I can't let you in, Michael.
Michael: Dwight, just...
Dwight: No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
Michael: Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
Dwight: You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Michael: OK.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #959]

Michael:  ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #960]

Michael: I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
Uncle Al: Phyllis and you will be great together.
Michael: We are great together. We are a great team.
Uncle Al: The Celtics were a great team.
Michael: Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
Uncle Al: Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know!
Michael: Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #961]

Michael: Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
Phyllis: You found Uncle Al!
Michael: Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
Phyllis: Thank you, Michael.
Michael: You're... You're welcome.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #962]

Michael: They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.


[Date: February 9, 2007, Session #963]

Michael: Be careful. Oh no!!  Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! 

[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #964]

Michael: Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Kevin: My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Michael: Huh?
Kevin: I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Michael: Pop quiz.
Kevin: ...What?
Michael: Why is today a special day?
Kevin: I almost died.
Michael: Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
Ryan: You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Michael: In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Kevin: Wow.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #965]

Michael: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #966]

Michael: Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
Dwight: Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #967]

Michael: Will they throw their hats, you think?
Ryan: What?
Michael: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Ryan: Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
Michael: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.
Ryan: ...It doesn't apply.
Michael: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!
Ryan: Quit it!
Michael: We have fun.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #968]

Michael: Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!
College Student: ....Dude.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #969]

Michael: Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
Ryan: ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Michael: I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #970]

Ryan: And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Michael: Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #971]

Michael: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or...  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied?


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #972]

Michael: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: ...And products!
Ryan: What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Michael: Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Business Student #1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Michael: We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. 


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #973]

Business Student #2: What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
Michael: ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
Business Student #2: Has anyone ever come back?
Michael: ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
Business Student #3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
Michael: Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
Business Student #3: ...What?
Michael: Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Business Student #1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
Michael: ...Wait, Ryan said that?


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #974]

Michael: Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
Business Student #2: But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
Michael: David will always beat Goliath.
Business Student #1: But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...
Michael: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Business Student #1: But in the big picture...
Michael: Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #975]

Ryan: ...It wasn't personal.
Michael: Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
Ryan: Pack my--?
Michael: You heard me, pack your things.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #976]

Ryan: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Michael: Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
Ryan: To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Michael: A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #977]

Artist: Thanks for coming.
Michael: Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Pam: Oh, Michael.
Michael: Wow! You did these... freehand?
Pam: Yep.
Michael: My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
Pam: What do you mean?
Michael: I don't see a... price.
Pam: Um... you wanna buy it?
Michael: Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
Pam: Uh-huh.
Michael: That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Pam:  ... Thank you.
Michael: What?
Pam: Do you have something in your pocket?
Michael: ...Chunky. Do you want half?
Pam: No thank you.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #978]

Michael: It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #979]

Michael: Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #980]

Jim: OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Michael: Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
Jim: Those are the books that sum up the other books.
Michael: So no?
Jim: What are you reading?
Michael: Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
Jim: Oh, that could be interesting.
Michael: No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
Jim:  I am ready.
Michael: Don't do what I say, say what I do.
Jim: Five.
Michael: Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
Jim: Hmm... Five.
Michael: This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
Jim: No, I got it.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #981]

Michael: Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks.  Just stand right up.
Ryan: Michael it's not... It's not...
Michael: That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #982]

Michael: I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple...  Kids love candy bars.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #983]

Michael: Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.


[Date: February 15, 2007, Session #984]

Student 1: How have you adopted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Michael: Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else?  Yep.
Student 2: Just following up on that first question...
Michael: No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
Student 2: OK.
Michael: OK.
Student 2: New question.
Michael: Very good.
Student 2: In the digital age...
Michael: OK.
Student 2: ... email...
Michael: Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
Student 3: Do you believe your high fixed cost are warranted given your diminishing market share.
Michael: How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.


[Date: February 22, 2007, Session #985]

Michael: Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
Dwight: Yes. But this  seems to be...
Michael: And now, the chains.


[Date: February 22, 2007, Session #986]

Michael: A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.


[Date: February 22, 2007, Session #987]

Michael: MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
Dwight: I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Michael: No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
Jim: Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Michael: I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
Pam: So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
Michael: No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. 
Michael: AHHHH!
Kevin: Is everything ok, Michael?
Michael: Yes.


[Date: February 22, 2007, Session #988]

Michael: I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #989]

Michael: Alright.
Dwight: 
Michael: Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Jim: Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Dwight: It's early bird gets the worm.
Michael: Pam, would you smell my breath?
Pam: No, no.
Dwight: Let me smell.  Good, not great.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #990]

Michael: Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #991]

Michael: Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
Jim: Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Michael: Sure? Might be a good idea.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Jim: Thanks.
Michael: Play some games?
Jim: Oh. Um. I think we're good.
Michael: I spy?
Jim: Yeah.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #992]

Dwight: Thanks for inviting me along.
Michael: Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Hey, Buttercup.
Jan: Hi.
Michael: I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
Jan: Let's just blow this party off.
Michael: That's what she said.
Jan: Am I on speaker phone?
Michael: Uh, yes you are.
Jan: Is anybody else in the...
Dwight: Hello, Jan.
Jan: Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Michael: No problem. 
Jan: Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
Michael: Ok.
Jan: ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Michael: Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
Jan: Still on speaker?
Michael: Ummm... I don't know.
Jan: Are camera's there?
Michael: Maybe.
Jan: See you soon.
Michael: Ok.
Dwight: Talk to you later, Jan.
Michael: Alright. Bye.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #993]

Michael: Beauty. Thank you sir!
Dwight: Salad.
Michael: Thank you.
Dwight: You dressed exactly like the servants.
Michael: Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
Dwight: Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Michael: I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Dwight: That would have been really embarrassing.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Crisis averted.
Michael: Ok.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #994]

Michael: Hi.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #995]

Michael: Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #996]

Michael: Oh, um, potato salad.
Dwight: It's from both of us.
Michael: No, it's not.
Rachel: Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.
Michael: Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #997]

Michael: It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #998]

Michael: What are you looking for? You bring dip?
Jan: I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Michael: Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
Jan: You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Michael: Over our love.
Jan: I've never told you that I love you.
Michael: You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #999]

Jan: What's this over the 'i'?
Michael: It's a heart.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1000]

Michael: I love this woman!
Jan: Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1001]

Rachel: Hello Michael.
Michael: Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
David: Jan, glad you could make it.
Jan: Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
David: Of course I do.
Jan: From the Scranton Branch.
Michael: Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Jan: David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
Rachel: Excuse me.
Michael: Ok.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1002]

Man: So did the merger go smoothly, or?
Michael: It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
Karen: I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Michael: Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
Jan: We're good.  Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Rachel: Can I get anyone anything, or?
Michael: I could go for an appeteaser.
Jan: Martini please.
Michael: Bagel bites or something.
Karen: Rachel, your house is beautiful.
Rachel: Thank you.
Dwight: What's the square footage?
David: About 5,000.
Dwight: Does that include the garage?
Michael: Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
Dwight: I'm just...
David: I don't know
Dwight: It's a common question.
Michael: David, how much did this house cost?
Dwight: These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Rachel: I'll show you around.
Dwight: Cool, let's start with the banisters.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1003]

David: This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
Michael: Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. 
Jan: You ok?
Michael: Yeah. Do you have any ice?
David: Sure.
Michael: How about some Splenda?


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1004]

Michael: This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
Jan: It's nice.
Michael: You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
Jan: I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Michael: Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
Jim: Oh.
Michael: Crazy.
Jan: I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Michael: Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
Jan: Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. 
Michael: What are you doing?
Jan: Don't you know what I'm doing?
Michael: Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
Jan: Shut up.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1005]

Michael: What has gotten into you?
Jan: Come on.
Michael: No, no, no.
Jan: What?
Michael: Come on, let's go back to the party.
Jan: Just let me loosen my dress.
Michael: Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
Jan: Slam me up against the wall, right here.
Michael: I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
Jan: Oh, please.
Michael: You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
Jan: Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1006]

Michael: Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1007]

Michael: Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
Jan: I feel sick.
Michael: You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Jan: No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Michael: Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
Jan: Please don't cry.
Michael: I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
Jan: It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
Michael: I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Jan: I didn't mean it. I was...
Michael: Whatever.
Jan: Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Michael: That's all, you didn't mean it?
Jan: That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Michael: I love you, Jan.
Jan: Ok.
Dwight: Don't break up you guys, you're great together.


[Date: February 23, 2007, Session #1008]

Michael: What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.

[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1009]

Michael: No need for consternation, everything is under control.
Jan: Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Michael: It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
Jan:  Is Toby there?
Michael: No...
Toby: I'm... here, Jan.
Jan: Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
Toby: Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
Jan: Thank God.
Toby: Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
Michael: No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
Jan: All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Michael: Yeppers.
Jan: What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
Michael: I don't... remember.
Jan: I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
Michael: Yeesh...


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1010]

Michael: Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
Jim: Where'd you get that?
Michael: Wikipedia.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1011]

Michael: Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1012]

Michael: Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
Jim: Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Michael: Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think...  that maybe you should... 
Jim: I can't hear you.
Michael: What I'm saying is that, 
Jim: Still nothin'.
Michael: Ok, see what I did?
Jim: No.
Michael: By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
Jim: Nice.
Michael: Ok, let's try another one.  Um...
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
Jim: And what happens in this one?
Michael: It's a surprise.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
Jim: Can I have a raise?
Michael: 
Jim:  Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
Michael: What?
Jim: What?
Michael: No, what did you say?
Jim: I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Michael: Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1013]

Michael:  Yeah.
Darryl: You ready for me?
Michael: Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
Darryl: Cool.
Michael: You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
Darryl: Okay.
Michael: No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1014]

Michael: Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1015]

Michael: Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1016]

Michael:  I am declining to speak first.
Darryl: Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Michael: Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
Darryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Michael: What?
Darryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Michael: No, this is a power suit.
Darryl: That there's a woman's suit.
Michael:  I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
Darryl: I'ma call Roy, man.
Michael: Ohh... kay.
Darryl: This is gonna make him feel better.
Michael: All right.
Darryl: This is too good.
Michael: Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
Pam: Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!
Kevin: You're wearing a woman's suit?
Michael: No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1017]

Michael: There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1018]

Kevin: Who makes it?
Michael: Uh,  MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
Phyllis: Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Michael: Okay.
Phyllis: Did you see...
Michael: Would you stop it, please?
Jim: So, none of that tipped you off?
Michael: It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.
Pam: Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
Michael: No, they don't.  See?  
Pam: 
Michael: Italians don't wear pockets.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1019]

Karen: Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
Michael: No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
Darryl: Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Michael: Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
Darryl: Okay, can you just stand right there?   I gotta send some e-mails.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1020]

Michael: Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1021]

Michael: Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
Darryl: Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
Michael: 
Darryl: What?  I can't hear you.
Michael:  That was a very good point.
Darryl: I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Michael:  You make a very compelling argument.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1022]

Michael: I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
Darryl: Why can't I just... tell you?
Michael: Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes.
Darryl: There you go.
Michael: Oh.  Come on.  Be serious.
Darryl: I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Michael: I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
Darryl: Come on, be for real Mike.
Michael: I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
Darryl:  Are you serious?  You're earning this?
Michael: Plus perks, yes.
Darryl: Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. 
Michael: Fourteen years.
Darryl: Ho-ho!
Michael: No, please, please...
Darryl: Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.   Ah. 
Michael: Ok, let's take 15, again.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1023]

Michael: A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1024]

Kevin: Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Michael: Oh, thank you.
Kevin: Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Creed: Here's the $40 you gave me.
Michael: I didn't give you $40.
Creed: In a way you did.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1025]

Darryl:  Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.    Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  
Michael: Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
Darryl: What?
Michael: I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
Darryl: That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Michael: Well what am I supposed to do?
Darryl: Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Michael: I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
Darryl: Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Michael:  That's true.
Darryl: Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Michael: You know what?  I should.
Darryl: Yeah, you should.
Michael: I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Darryl: Fourteen years long.
Michael: You know what?  I deserve a bump.
Darryl: Make it happen, cap'in.
Michael: I am makin' it happen, sergeant.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1026]

Jan: Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Michael: No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Jan: Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Michael: Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away.
Jan: Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Michael: Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
Jan: Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
Michael: Mm-hm.
Jan: No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Michael: Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
Jan: Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
Michael:  No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
Jan: ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Michael:  Fine.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1027]

Kelly: You are so mean.
Ryan: I don't know what you're talking about.
Kelly: Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Ryan: No, I said your idea was stupid.
Michael: Toby, come on.  Let's go.
Toby: Where?
Michael: Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
Kelly: What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Toby: Alright.
Kelly: Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
Ryan: Don't you see why that's insane?
Kelly: Oh, so I'm crazy now?


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1028]

Darryl: Comfortable, Mike?
Michael: Yeah.  Fine.
Darryl: How about you, man.  Comfortable?
Toby: No.
Michael:  Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
Darryl: Thank you.
Michael: Well...
Darryl: I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Michael: Mm, the Big Apple.
Darryl: Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Toby: How would we get home?
Darryl: Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Michael: Maybe I'll stay.
Darryl: Mm, it's not that big.
Michael: Well...
Darryl: Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Michael:  Oh, I...


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1029]

Hunter: Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.
Darryl: Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Michael: Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
Darryl: Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Michael: All right.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1030]

Jan: Thank you, Hunter.  Hello.  Come in.   Ah, Okay.
Michael: Who's the boy toy?
Jan: That's my new assistant.
Michael: Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Jan: I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Michael: Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Toby: Hi, Jan.
Jan: Hi, Toby.  First---  First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Michael: Pippity poppity.
Jan: Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Michael: Six percent?  After all we've been through?
Jan: Oh, God.
Michael: I got you... jade earrings.
Jan: Michael---
Michael: No!
Jan: Michael---
Michael: No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex.   What are you writing, perv-ball?
Toby: Just preparing for the deposition.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1031]

Michael: Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
Jan: Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Michael: Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.
Jan: Ok, Toby, how about if you...
Toby: Sure.
Jan: Great.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1032]

Jan: What's wrong with you?
Michael: Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Jan: Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Michael: Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Jan: No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Michael: Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
Jan: No.  But we can offer you 12.
Michael: But you just said 15.


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1033]

Michael: Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
Jan: Michael!


[Date: April 5, 2007, Session #1034]

Michael: Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.

[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1035]

Michael: Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1036]

Darryl: Now, this is the forklift.  You need---  You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
Michael: Hmm.
Darryl: Should you drive the forklift?
Michael: I can, and I have.
Darryl: No! No no no no no!  I said
Lonny: You're not allowed to drive the forklift.
Darryl: It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Michael: Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.   Pudge has driven the forklift.
Madge: Madge.
Michael: I thought your name was Pudge?
Madge: No, it's always been Madge.
Michael: Okay.  Um, her.
Darryl: Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Michael: Ah, fine.
Darryl: Do you understand that?
Michael: Yeeesh.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1037]

Michael:  'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' 


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1038]

Darryl: The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Dwight: Yeah!
Andy: It's on!
Darryl: How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Michael: Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
Lonny: Dammit, Michael.  Pay attention, man.
Darryl: Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Kevin: Five bucks says it's over 50.
Jim: You really wanna bet?
Darryl: Anybody?
Kevin: Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Guy: How many?
Jim: Ok, you're on.
Darryl: Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Kevin:  Damn...
Darryl:  You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Jim: No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Kevin: On what?
Jim: I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
Kevin: Nice.
Oscar: What are you guys talkin' about?
Darryl: These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Michael: Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Darryl: It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Lonny: What the
Michael: It's a big red trash compactor!
Lonny: What are you---
Darryl: It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
Lonny: Don't disrespect the baler!
Michael: Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
Darryl: No do not touch it!
Michael: ...would I go near---
Darryl: There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1039]

Michael: Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Toby: Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Michael: Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
Toby: Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
Michael: Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Darryl: Take them at the same time.
Michael: Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Toby: No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
Ryan: What about a long sleeve T?
Toby: Well, that'll work.
Kevin: Long johns?  A shaw?
Toby: You know, anything that warms you.
Michael: Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.    Sorry, he is very lame.   Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'
Darryl: Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Lonny: Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?
Michael: Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Darryl: Actually, you did.
Michael: Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---'
Toby: Sedentary.
Michael: Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Lonny: That's called having a fat butt, Michael.
Michael: Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
Lonny: Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's fat butt disease.  That's what you suffer from?
Michael: No.
Lonny: Fat butt disease, Michael?
Kelly: Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Lonny: Yeah?  I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?
Kelly: Ryan?
Lonny: Dude, tell your girl to shut up.
Kelly: What?!
Ryan: Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
Kelly: Are you kidding me?
Darryl: Alright, we outta here.
Michael: Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
Lonny: Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.
Darryl: That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Michael: Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1040]

Michael: Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1041]

Michael: Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
Pam: I don't understand the question.
Michael: Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
Pam: Yeah...
Michael: I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Pam: It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
Michael: Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
Pam: So, you're okay?
Michael: Indubitably.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1042]

Michael: They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
Dwight: Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Michael: I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
Dwight: Wolves.
Michael: Nn--- Depression.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1043]

Dwight: Visual aids.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: A quilt.  Depression quilt?
Michael: No time to sew a quilt.  ... I got it.  Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1044]

Michael: You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1045]

Dwight:  Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
Michael: Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
Dwight: We measured it once...
Michael: Go buy some watermelons.
Dwight: Seedless?
Michael: Just...


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1046]

Dwight: Ready?
Michael: Let's do it!  Drop that sucker.
Dwight: 
Michael: BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
Dwight: Got it.
Michael: Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Dwight: We're not allowed to use the baler.
Michael: Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Dwight: I'm on it!


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1047]

Dwight: Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
Michael: Yes, thank you for seeing that.
Dwight: When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Michael: I don't know if I wanna do this.
Dwight: Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Michael: No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Dwight: That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
Michael: Rock n' roll!
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: That's right!  I am not thinking.
Dwight:  Near near near near near!
Michael: Yes!  Yeah!
Dwight:  Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
Michael: Woo!
Dwight:  Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Michael: Woo!
Dwight:  Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Michael: I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! 


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1048]

Dwight:  Come on, hurry up you guys!
Michael:  My life!  Oh, my life...
Dwight:  Michael, what's wrong?!
Michael: Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Dwight: Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael: Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Dwight: Is that the last year the data was available?
Michael: Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
Dwight: Don't do anything rash!
Michael: Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Dwight: I didn't...  I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Michael: Okay... that's...
Dwight: you said to just...
Michael: That's the whole point, dummy.
Dwight: Okay, I'm on it!
Michael: Okay.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1049]

Dwight: Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Michael: Oooooh, my life!
Dwight: Michael!  What's wrong?
Michael: Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Dwight: Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael: Dwight, you ignorant slut.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1050]

Jim: Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Michael: And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Jim: Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1051]

Creed:  Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
Jim: Oh my God, there
Dwight: No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Michael: Damn it.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1052]

Jim: Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Pam: Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Michael: What is it?
Pam: Come down and... open it and you'll see.
Michael: Dwight, find out what the present is.
Dwight: Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Jim: Dwight...
Pam: Dwight, what are you---
Dwight: Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Michael: Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Darryl: Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Michael: You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
Darryl: Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Michael: What do I have to live for?
Darryl: A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Michael: It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
Darryl: Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
Michael: Do you really mean that?
Darryl: I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Michael: I'm braver than you?
Darryl: Way
Michael: I Braveheart.  I am.
Darryl: Come down, okay?
Michael: Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1053]

Michael: An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1054]

Michael: OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go.
Pam: I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
Michael: Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life.  saved it.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1055]

Michael: Here we go.
Dwight: Come on.
Michael: Field Trip.
Dwight: Step lively. Single file everybody.
Michael: Like we're going to the science museum.
Dwight: Let's single...
Michael: Learn by touching.
Dwight: Single... OK.
Michael: I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.
Dwight: Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.

Kelly: You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
Ryan: Totally, we should both work out.
Kelly: Screw you.
Michael: Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
Larry: Sir, could you please, please focus on Darryl?
Michael: I...
Larry: Try.
Darryl: Summing up.
Michael: Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1057]

Michael: We got beat today, Dwight.
Dwight: 
Michael: But it was not a fair fight.
Dwight: No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
Michael: It was the warehouse guys...
Dwight: Right.
Michael: ... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
Dwight: Argh!
Michael: ... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
Dwight: Ghaaa!


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1058]

Michael: You know what's funny? Robin Williams.  When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety.  Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1059]

Michael: How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1060]

Michael: Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. 


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1061]

Andy:  You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
Dwight: Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Michael: Yeah, Drew.
Andy: Yes bosses.
Michael: You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
Dwight: OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Michael: OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1062]

Andy:  Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
Michael: I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.
Creed:  Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
Kelly: Give me that thing, I want to try.
Jim: Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Kelly: I was just going to say that  you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Angela: I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Dwight: OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
Angela: OK, it's three forty eight.
Jim: OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Ryan: Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Jim: Come on.
Stanley: Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Jim: Come on. He'll listen to you.
Everyone: Come on Ryan.
Angela: Let's do it.
Dwight: Come on pretty boy.
Ryan: Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Michael: I will miss you the most Ryan.
Ryan: Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Andy: Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
Jim: Oh!
Andy: Up to you.
Jim: No no no!
Andy: If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
Pam: Hey!
Jim: OK. careful, thanks. 
Andy: Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!


[Date: April 12, 2007, Session #1063]

Michael: Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management.  Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1064]

Michael: No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?
Toby: OK I think Oscar would just like if you used 'lame' or something like that.
Michael: That's what faggie means!
Toby: No not really...


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1065]

Toby: Apparently you called Oscar 'faggie' for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
Michael: It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
Toby: All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.
Michael: Exactly!
Toby: I mean for real.
Michael: Yeah, I know.
Toby: No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
Michael: OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
Toby: OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1066]

Michael: I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'.  It's bad taste.  You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1067]

Michael: Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
Oscar: No, it's fine.
Michael: No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
Oscar: That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1068]

Michael: Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
Dwight: Of course.
Michael: What about Oscar?
Dwight: Absolutely not.
Michael: Well, he
Dwight: Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Michael:  There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else.
Dwight: You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
Michael: Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1069]

Michael: Hey, what about Angela?   She's hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.
Dwight: I really don't think so.
Michael: I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
Dwight: 


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1070]

Michael: Do some research.  Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
Dwight: Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Michael: That's ridiculous.
Dwight: Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Michael:  Let's call him and get the website.
Dwight: Definitely.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1071]

Michael: Well, they're sold out.
Dwight: Damn.    I'll try Brookstone.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1072]

Jan: You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
Michael: I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
Jan: That's not what it's called.
Toby: OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
Michael: What?  What does that even...
Jan: Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
Michael: Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.
Toby: All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
Michael: I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
Jan: NO!
Michael: I don't kn--
Jan: No, it's not possible.
Michael: Anything's possible.
Jan: You know, imagine... you were gay.
Michael:  Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
Jan: Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1073]

Michael: The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1074]

Oscar: Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Michael: Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1075]

Michael:  Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood!  I don't particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1076]

Michael:  All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1077]

Michael: Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1078]

Michael: We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you.
Oscar: Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1079]

Michael: Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
Angela: Judges and juries!
Michael: Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
Kevin: : That sounds great.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1080]

Dwight: I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Oscar: No one else in this office is gay.
Dwight: What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Phyllis: I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
Michael: That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!   See?  Everybody has a chance!


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1081]

Michael: But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!
Phyllis: No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
Michael:  Right!   And I take that as a compliment.
Phyllis: Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
Michael: Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
Oscar: You sound pretty defensive Michael.
Michael: No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
Oscar: I think the problem with this office is that
Michael: No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1082]

Michael: Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
Oscar: I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
Michael: You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---
Oscar: I would rather not.
Michael: ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1083]

Oscar: No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
Michael: All right, um... sorry.
Oscar: Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. 
Michael:  I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1084]

Michael: You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.    I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. 
Michael:   Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1085]

Michael: We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1086]

Michael: I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1087]

Michael: Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1088]

Jan:  Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?
Michael: I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
Jan:  Heaven help us.  Specifically.
Michael: I will do my
Jan: Specifically
Michael: Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1089]

Michael: Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1090]

Jan:  Are you on the toilet, Michael?
Michael:  No.
Jan: Well, I know sometimes you are and... that you wouldn't tell me, so I'm just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you're finished.
Michael: Okay. 
Toby: Michael?
Michael: 


[Date: September 21, 2006, Session #1091]

Michael: Hi, honey.  You holding up?
Pam: Yup.
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: I'm... painting my new apartment tonight.
Michael: Oh, good. By yourself?
Pam: Yes.
Michael: Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much.
Pam: Thanks.
Michael: Roy.
Pam: Right.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1092]

Pam:  Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Jim:  Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Phyllis:  I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Stanley:  I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Michael:  It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1093]

Michael: We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1094]

Michael: Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Dwight: Cri-Man-Squa?
Michael: Crisis Management Squad.
Ryan: F and C, doubletime?
Michael: Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
Jim: One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Michael: To save time, Jim.
Karen: Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Pam: Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
Michael: You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Creed: Here.
Michael: Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1095]

Michael: We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
Oscar: That's really not our job.
Michael: Midnight, Oscar!
Angela: Kelly's training us?


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1096]

Michael: Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
Jim: Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
Michael: No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
Jim: All right.
Michael: I want you to bring a partner.
Ryan: I'll go.
Michael: No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
Andy:  William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
Jim: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
Michael: No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
Dwight: Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
Pam: We're having a press conference?
Michael: No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Dwight: Not! 


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1097]

Michael: Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1098]

Michael: I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
Jim: Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Michael: Here


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1099]

Michael: OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
Dwight: On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1100]

Michael: Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1101]

Michael: And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
Dwight:  You look good in this.
Michael: So, let us consider this matter ended.
Barbara: Well it isn't ended.  I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
Michael: I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
Barbara: I don't accept your apology.  The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
Michael: Well, we are extremely sorry.
Barbara: I don't accept.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1102]

Michael: We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
Barbara: Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.
Michael: The watermark... it's a one time thing.
Barbara: I don't care!  It was disgusting.  Cartoon characters having sex?
Dwight: May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
Michael: OK...


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1103]

Michael: What... can I do, for you?
Barbara: I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
Michael: Well...  OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
Barbara: You're the head---
Michael: The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Barbara: You're the head of the company!
Michael: I'm
Barbara: Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---
Michael: No, I'm a regional manager---
Barbara: And so you should lose your job!
Michael: No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
Barbara: Fine.
Michael: That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Barbara: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: It's non-transferable...
Michael: Doesn't matter.  Out please!
Barbara: I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.
Michael: Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?
Chad Lite: Everything.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1104]

Michael: We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
Pam: It's just the Scranton Times...
Michael: No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
Pam: You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Michael: You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.   Do you know what this is for?
Pam: Yes.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1105]

Michael:  OK, I think that's good.


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1106]

Michael: Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.'
Dwight: Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Michael: That's how devoted I am to this job.
Dwight: I'm just saying...
Michael: I know.
Dwight: They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
Michael: I understand that, Dwight.
Dwight: You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Michael: Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Dwight: Cut.
Michael: So I'll know where---
Pam: Cut.
Michael: I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
Pam: Cut.
Michael: OK, ready?


[Date: April 26, 2007, Session #1107]

Michael: Five, four, three.  'There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn't be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me.  They're trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.'
Pam: One day for what?
Michael: That's... they always give an ultimatum.
Pam: OK.
Michael: Good, cut?
Pam: Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
Michael: Thought so too.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1108]

Michael: The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1109]

Michael: With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1110]

Michael: So we're good?
Barbara Allen: No, we're not.
Michael: I'm sorry.
Barbara Allen: Well, okay. But I don't accept.
Dwight:  Say you're sorry times infinity...
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: ...'cause there's no comeback for that.
Michael: All right. We are infinitely sorry.
Barbara Allen: I'm still furious.
Michael: You understand? You... you get this check.
Barbara Allen: Mmm.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1111]

Michael: The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1112]

Michael: Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1113]

Michael: And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1114]

Michael: Are we ready?
Dwight: Final touch-ups.
Michael: Okay. Am I shiny?
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
Dwight: I don't know...
Michael:  Stop it.
Dwight: 


[Date: April 27, 2007, Session #1115]

Michael: I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1116]

Pam:  It's just, like, so creepy.
Ryan:  Yeah. 
Michael: What's happening?
Pam: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Michael: Really? Is she OK?
Pam: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Michael: OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm. 
Angela: What is so funny?
Michael: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
Kevin: I'm guessing not.
Michael:  I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Jim: Mm... not really, no.
Pam: It's disgusting and demeaning.
Michael: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  He's back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh! 
Toby: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Michael: What? Oh. 
Toby: What's going on?
Michael: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... 
Toby: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Michael: Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Toby: I don't think the women in this office -
Michael: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Toby: I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Michael: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1117]

Michael: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1118]

Jan:  Michael, ...
Michael: Huh?
Jan: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Michael: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Jan: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
Michael: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
Jan: $300?
Michael: I... uh, well, I don't know.
Jan: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Hunter:  You got it, Jan.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1119]

Michael:  I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
Dwight: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Michael: OK.
Dwight:  There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Michael: This is the last
Dwight: Look at that one.
Michael: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. 


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1120]

Michael: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
Dwight: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Jim:  Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Dwight: Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking.  Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
Pam: Phallus?
Dwight: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1121]

Phyllis: I didn't really get a good look.
Pam: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Karen: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out?  'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
Dwight: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Karen: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Dwight: Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Pam:  'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. 
Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
Karen: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Michael: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
Dwight: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Michael: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
Jim: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Michael: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
Dwight:  Mm, less than three.
Michael: That is not current.
Dwight: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Jim: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Dwight: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Michael: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1122]

Michael: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Creed: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Michael: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Meredith: I don't remember doing that.
Angela: What a surprise.
Michael: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
Dwight: Alien
Michael: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Andy: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Kevin: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Karen: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
Michael: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
Karen: I'm saying that you're being sexist.
Michael: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Karen: That - it's the same thing.
Phyllis: Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Michael: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Dwight: I wish I could menstruate.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1123]

Karen: Can we just get back to work?
Michael: Ye - OK, yes.
Angela: This is not work talk.
Michael: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. 


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1124]

Michael: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Let's go!
Dwight: Have you finished with the sketch?
Pam: Yeah.
Dwight: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
Pam: Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
Dwight: Hmm.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1125]

Michael:  I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - 
Meredith: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Michael: Many women


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1126]

Michael: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
Kelly: Thanks, Michael.
Angela: Thank you, Michael.
Michael: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
Pam: What do you want to dish about?
Michael: Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.
Pam: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Kelly: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Michael: What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Phyllis: Oh, it can be fun.
Michael: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
Karen: It's a pretty common one.
Michael: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Angela: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1127]

Pam: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Michael: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
Pam: Oh, my God.
Michael:  And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
Karen: That is not healthy behavior.
Michael: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
Pam: Michael, you need to get out of this.
Michael: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
Pam: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. 
Michael: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? 


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1128]

Pam: Read the pros first.
Michael: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Phyllis: She does have very nice clothes.
Karen: OK, OK. Um, cons.
Michael: Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
Pam: What was the last one?
Michael: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Phyllis: No, the one before that.
Michael: I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
Pam: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Michael: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Karen: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Michael: Yeah, that's smart.
Pam: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Michael: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
Phyllis: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Michael: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Phyllis: My mom taught me that.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1129]

Michael: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Pam: No one said it has no calories.
Michael: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1130]

Michael: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1131]

Michael: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Karen: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Phyllis: Jim's gonna love it. 


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1132]

Angela:  Slower. Slower. Meredith.  Slow it up.
Michael: Oh. Oh, no.   It's Jan. What do I do?
Karen: Answer it.
Pam: Don't answer it.
Michael: OK, it stopped.
Kelly:  Whoa.
Meredith:  Crap.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1133]

Kelly: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Michael: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Pam: Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
Michael: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right. 
Pam: I think I've got it.
Michael: Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Pam: I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Michael: Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1134]

Michael: OK, I am really going to do this.
Pam: Good luck, Michael.
Michael: You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. 
Karen: OK, remember, be strong.
Michael: I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
Pam: Don't leave a -
Michael:  Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Jan: Michael...  I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So...  I'm sorry.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: So... we're good?
Michael: Abso-fruit-ly.
Jan:  Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Michael: No... No...
Jan: One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: OK.  'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Michael: Maybe some Italian.  '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -'  Chinese?  'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
Jan: Oh. 


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1135]

Michael:  Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1136]

Jan: So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Michael: Love it.
Jan: Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Michael: Uh, yes, I am.
Jan: Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Michael: Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
Jan: Wait, wait, what cartoons?
Michael: The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Jan: 
Michael: We should really start recycling.
Jan: Right uh, Michael.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1137]

Michael: Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
Jim: No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1138]

Michael: Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1139]

Michael: I got shotgun.  Damn it.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1140]

Michael: Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1141]

Michael: Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1142]

Michael: Idiot.


[Date: May 3, 2007, Session #1143]

Michael: I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.

[Date: May 10, 2007, Session #1144]

Michael: Ughh... Blech.
Dwight: OK, where does it hurt?
Michael: Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Dwight: No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Michael: Right there. 
Dwight:  'Abdomen. Menses.'
Michael: Maybe.
Dwight: The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Michael: Not it. I don't have eggs.


[Date: May 10, 2007, Session #1145]

Dwight: Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Michael: That's possible.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Uh-huh?
Pam: David Wallace is on line one.
Michael: The CFO? Ohh...
Michael: OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.


[Date: May 10, 2007, Session #1146]

Michael: To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
David:  Michael, I am calling---
Michael: And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
David: Jan is out of town right now.
Michael: Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
David: Michael?
Michael: ...you just gots to get your freak on.
David: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
David: Michael?
Michael: Hmmm.
David: I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Michael: Really?
David: Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Michael: Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
David: That's not necessary.
Michael: May God guide you in your quest.
David: Yes.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1147]

Michael: OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1148]

Michael: Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Oscar: I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Michael: Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1149]

Toby: Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
Michael: Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Toby: It's Beach Day...
Michael: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1150]

Michael: I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1151]

Toby: Hey, want my sun screen?
Pam: Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
Toby: Uh-huh.
Pam: Thanks Toby.
Michael: Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
Pam: I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Michael: We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1152]

Michael: What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1153]

Pam: You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Michael: I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1154]

Michael: This way to the partay bus.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1155]

Michael: Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
Stanley: Oh, sweet mother of God.
Michael: If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Stanley: Excuse me?
Michael: Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Dwight: Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Michael: Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Dwight: I hope there will be management parables.
Michael: Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Pam: Like what?
Michael: Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Pam: Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
Michael: Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1156]

Michael: Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1157]

Angela: Everyone put on sunscreen.
Michael: Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle 'round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Oscar: What?
Michael: Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1158]

Michael: Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1159]

Dwight: I choose Michael!
Michael: I'm not playing.
Dwight: OK, temp.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1160]

Michael: Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1161]

Michael: We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Dwight: We will be called Gryffindor.
Jim: Really? Not Slytherin?
Dwight: Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Jim: I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Dwight: He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Jim:  Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Dwight: OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
Stanley: I don't care what you call my team.
Michael: Then I will name your team the Red team.
Stanley: No , the blue team.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1162]

Michael: I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1163]

Andy: We will be team U.S.A.
Michael: Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1164]

Michael: Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1165]

Michael: It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Stanley: There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Michael: Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! 
Oscar: Come on Phyllis, you can do it.  Ahh...
Stanley: Thank you so much.  
Andy: Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. 
Kelly: I don't want to hit the big rock!
Andy: Don't worry. You're not...
Kelly: I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Andy: No where near the big rock.
Kelly:  I just don't want to get hit by it...
Andy: What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1166]

Pam: There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. 
Michael:  Pam...you're missing things. 


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1167]

Michael: Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Pam: Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Michael: Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Pam: When's the contest?
Michael: Like umm... ten minutes?
Pam: How am I supposed to... get...
Michael: Thanks a bunch.

Michael: A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1169]

Michael: OK, who's hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
Kelly: Can I have a turkey burger?
Michael: No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Oscar: Turkey is a healthy meat.
Dwight: It's very good for you. 
Michael: Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
Phyllis: Is there any mustard?
Michael: No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Michael: Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
Meredith:  What is it?
Michael: I can't say.
Jim: You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Michael: The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
Kelly: Can we just take those first two things?
Michael: The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
Dwight: You're leaving?
Michael: I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Andy:  I am so hungry! 
Stanley: Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
Michael:  Word.  There we go. Let's see it.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1170]

Michael: Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
Kelly: Team U.S.A.!
Andy: One came up.
Michael: 13 hot dogs, everybody!
Dwight: Damn it!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1171]

Michael: It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Stanley: Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Michael: Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.
Karen: Get 'em big boy!
Michael: Aaaaaand, go!
Karen: C'mon, Jim!
Stanley: 
Jim: What are you doing?
Michael: Nice, Stanley!
Stanley:  Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
Jim: Yeah. No. Good.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1172]

Dwight:  Gaaaaa....
Michael: One. Two. Three.
Dwight: Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Michael: Excellent!
Dwight: Gryffindor! Gryffindor!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1173]

Michael: I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Pam: I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
Michael: Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Pam: I really doubt it, Michael.
Michael: Please just check.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1174]

Michael: What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Stanley: How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Michael: Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1175]

Michael: Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
Kevin: Are you going to try it?
Angela: I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Kevin: Angela, it is a million degrees.
Pam: I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Michael: No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Pam: I'd like to try it.
Michael: Pointless.
Pam: But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Michael: Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Jim: Nope.
Michael: Ji.. why not? C'mon.
Jim: Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Michael: You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Jim: That's harsh.
Michael: Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1176]

Kevin: Why don't you go Michael?
Michael: Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Jim: And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Michael: Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.
Pam: Do you want us to count to three?
Michael: Yes. Count to three, please.
Group: Three. Two. One.
Michael: Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Group: One. Two. Three!  Go! Do it!  Go, Michael.
Michael: Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Creed: On the go that's after three.
Michael: Okay.
Group: One, two, three, go!
Dwight: No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Michael: Don't, don't.
Dwight:  I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Group: Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving.
Dwight:  GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Michael: I'm not going to give it to you.
Dwight:  Aaagh, aaagh!
Group: 
Pam: Michael, do something!
Dwight: Aggggh, that stings!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1177]

Michael: Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
Angela: Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Michael: Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
Kelly: Who's Bob Hope?
Michael: God! He's a comedian.
Kelly: Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Michael: Who's Amanda Bynes?
Kelly: She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
Michael: Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Jim: Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael: You are being too modest.
Jim: Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Michael: Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
Dwight: The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1178]

Dwight:  I mean truly repulsive acts.
Michael: That is a very, very funny story.
Pam:  Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.   Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Michael: Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1179]

Group: Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.  They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da.  From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da.  When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!
Michael: WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
Andy: Nice!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1180]

Michael: So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Phyllis: Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Michael: No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1181]

Michael: Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
Pam: You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Michael: Acrimonious.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1182]

Michael: This way to the party bus. Good.
Meredith:  Um, What the hell?
Michael: It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
Meredith: Um, I forgot my...
Michael: Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
All: Yeah!
Michael: Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. 


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1183]

Dwight: Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
Michael: Nothing.
Dwight: If I guess, will you tell me?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Please?
Michael: No!
Dwight: Is that a sumo suit?
Michael: No.
Dwight: I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Michael: No, we are not.
Dwight: Please tell me. I've been so good...
Michael: You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
Dwight: Please.
Michael: ...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight: Please.
Meredith: Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Michael: No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
Meredith: Pull over! Pull over! 


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1184]

Michael: Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1185]

Michael: Any questions?
Jim: Just one.
Michael: Yup.
Jim: The torches are lit.
Michael: Yes, for dramatic affect.
Jim: No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Michael: Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Jim: Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Michael: Set!
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Go!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1186]

Michael:  Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Pam: Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Michael: Because he wasn't following the rules.
Pam: I think they were just having fun.
Michael: But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
Pam: It tells me nothing.
Michael: Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
Pam: There's 800 of them!
Michael: Okay, all right.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1187]

Michael: It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...
Meredith: Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
Michael: Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
Phyllis: Is there any mustard?
Michael: No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
Everyone: That's what she said!
Michael: No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
Dwight: I do!
Michael: Who's got the hungry?
Dwight: I do!
Michael: Come on, Ryan...
Dwight: Let's go.
Michael: Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1188]

Michael:  Ready! Go!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1189]

Ryan: Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Michael: You? You haven't made a sale.
Ryan: I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Michael: Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1190]

Michael: Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!


[Date: May 11, 2007, Session #1191]

Michael: This is an inflatable sumo suit.  Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed.  And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins.  It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit...  that will tell me all I need to know  or how sumo... 

[Date: May 17, 2007, Session #1192]

Michael:  David!
David:  Oh, Michael?
Michael: Are we all set?
David: Isn't our interview tomorrow?
Michael: Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
David: You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Michael: Thought I'd catch a show.
David: In the middle of a work day?
Michael: Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
David: Okay.
Michael: Um, how many people are you interviewing?
David: We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Michael: Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
David: I don't think so.
Michael: Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
David: I believe we put you in charge.
Michael: Ah, great. No further questions.
David: Okay, Michael.
Michael: Okay.
David: I'm really looking forward to our interview.
Michael: And I'm really looking forward to working with you.


[Date: May 17, 2007, Session #1193]

Michael: I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1194]

Michael:  Yeah.
Dwight: You wanted to see me?
Michael: Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: But that's my name.  Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch.   Thank you.
Michael: Okay. Uh...
Dwight:  Thank you, Michael.
Michael: Uh, okay.
Dwight:  Thank you so much.
Michael: Stop crying.
Dwight:  Thank you.
Michael: Ohhhhh...


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1195]

Jim: So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Michael: Why so you can do it?
Karen: 
Jim: Whoops.
Michael: No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Jim: Hmmm.
Karen: Heh.
Michael: Moon each other.
Jim: Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Michael: All right.
Jim: All right.
Michael: Your loss.
Karen: Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Michael: Cruise control.
Karen: Oh.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1196]

Michael: There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Kevin: Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Michael: No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Oscar: Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Michael: No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Oscar: Michael...
Kevin: What?
Angela: Why?
Oscar: I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Michael: Yes, I...
Angela: Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Kevin: Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Michael: I have to buy another place.
Angela: But you said you were in debt. 
Oscar: You're not sure that you have the job.
Michael: I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1197]

Michael: Who is D. Abramson?
Pam: He's from that company in Pitts...
Jan:  Michael.
Michael: Why... are you here?
Jan: Uh, how are you?
Michael: I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Jan: I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Michael: Why privately?
Jan: I just,  I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Michael: Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Jan: Okay.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1198]

Michael: Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Pam: What do you want me to do?
Michael: Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Pam: What about Meredith?
Michael: No. She's an alternate.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1199]

Michael: So, how you been?
Jan: Been good.
Michael: Good.
Jan: Good.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Michael: Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1200]

Jan: After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Michael: Hmm.
Jan: To kinda clear my mind.
Michael: Sound good. Sounds fun.
Jan: It was.  Yeah, it was good.  I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Michael: Hmm..
Jan: I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Michael: Would you excuse me for a second?
Jan: Ohh... 


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1201]

Michael: Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
Phyllis: What are you gonna do?
Michael: I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
Karen: Do you want to get back together with her?
Michael: No, no. What do I do?
Pam: Just don't get back together with her.
Michael: What if she makes me?
Angela: How can she make you get back together with her?
Michael: She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
Pam: This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Michael: I wasn't.
Pam: You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Michael: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Pam: Right.
Michael: Wow.
Karen: Do it.
Michael: I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1202]

Michael:  Okay.  Jan, we need to talk. 


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1203]

Michael: Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1204]

Jan: So...  there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Michael: First got priorities.
Jan: And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Michael: Let's get back together. 


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1205]

Michael: No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1206]

Michael:  Remarkable.
Jan: Thanks.
Michael: Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Jan: Oh, okay.
Michael: Very good 
Jan: Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Michael: Yes, indeed.
Jan: Good luck with your interview.  Bye.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1207]

Michael: So, I guess we're getting back together.
Pam: What happened?
Michael: Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1208]

Michael: Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1209]

Michael: Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,   I would like to start saying my goodbyes  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1210]

Michael:  How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
Karen: Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
Michael: I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
Jim:  Who's that?
Michael: That
Jim: Beardy?
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Jim: I'm gonna introduce myself.
Michael: No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1211]

Michael: I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1212]

Michael: Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Hunter: Uh, administrative assistant.
Michael: Jan in yet?
Hunter: I think she's comin' in... later.
Michael: Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Hunter: Sure.
Michael: Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.
Hunter: Okay.
Michael: Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her,  'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1213]

Michael:  Hello, hello!
David: Michael, good to see you!
Michael: Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
David: Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work.  So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Michael: Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
David: Okay.  And your strengths?
Michael: Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
David: Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Michael: Thank you.
David: Very good.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1214]

David: What do you think we could be doing better?
Michael: I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
David: Okay!
Michael: Okay.
David: Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
Michael: Thank you.
David: It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Michael: It is always a treat when
David: You're back together.
Michael: Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
David: Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
Michael: I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
David: No, we're letting Jan go.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1215]

Jan: Hey you!
Michael: Hey.
Jan: How was your interview?
Michael: Pretty good.
Jan: Yeah?
Michael: Could have gone better I guess.
Jan: Oh.  I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael: Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Jan: What?
Michael: Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
Jan: What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Michael: I can't tell you.
Jan: Tell me what?


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1216]

Jan: You son of a bitch!
David: Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Jan: You're
David: Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Jan: Erratic?
David: Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
Jan:  Is it because of these?
Michael: Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Jan: No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
David: It's not.
Jan: No?
David: It's not.
Jan: Cause he likes them.  Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
David: The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Michael: Hey!
Jan: Yeah!
Michael: No--- We're all unstable.
Jan: Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Michael: David, I did not tell her.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1217]

Jan:  Bye Hunter.
Hunter: Bye.
Jan: Good luck with your band.
Hunter: Oh, thank---
Jan: Don't let them change you, okay?  So long, .
Michael: So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
David: Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
Michael: Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
David: No, we're not giving you the job.
Michael: You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
David: I do.
Michael: Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
David: Yes.
Michael: Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1218]

Jan: Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Michael: I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
Jan: Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... 
Michael: Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
Jan:  Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Michael:  I don't know.   Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale.  Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
Jan: Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15.  It could work.  This could work, really!


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1219]

Michael:  I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
Pam: How'd it go?
Michael: No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1220]

Michael: Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
Dwight: To intimidate my subordinates.
Michael: That's stupid.
Dwight: It was Andy's idea.
Michael: You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.   Ryan, coffee.
Ryan: I don't do that stuff anymore.
Michael: No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1221]

Michael: So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
Pam: Did... Karen get the job?
Michael:  Back to work.  Still waitin' on that coffee.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1222]

David: Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Michael: Well,  I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
David: A... multivitamin?
Michael: Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1223]

Phyllis: Michael, what happened?
Michael: Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Oscar: Home is where the
Michael: Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate?  I think not!


[Date: May 18, 2007, Session #1224]

Michael: New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had,  but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.

[Date: September 28, 2006, Session #1225]

Michael: Pam?
Pam: Yeah?
Michael: Did you see Oprah yesterday?
Pam: No, I didn't.
Michael: I, uh... I am going to be a father.
Pam: What was Oprah about?
Michael: Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
Pam: That's a really big decision.
Michael: I know.
Pam: Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
Michael: Well...
Pam: Or not adopt.
Michael: Just do it, okay?
Pam: Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
Michael: Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
Pam: You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
Michael: Eight months?
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
Pam: You probably won't.
Michael: You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
Pam: No, Michael.
Michael: Twenty years.
Pam: No, Michael.
Michael: Thirty.
Pam: Sure.
Michael: It's a deal.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1226]

Ryan: All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
Michael: Yesh.
Ryan: Uh, fun jeans.
Michael: Right there. Ah.
Angela: Sign.
Michael: Per diem.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1227]

Michael: Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1228]

Kelly: Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
Michael: Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
Kelly: My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
Michael: Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
Dwight: And your veil.
Michael: Yeah, do it!
Pam: I'll probably just wear this.
Michael: Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
Pam: Um...
Michael: Um. Okay, um.
Dwight: Um.
Michael: You got that?
Dwight: I got it.
Michael: Write it down.
Dwight: I got it.
Dwight: Um.
Michael: Um.
Dwight and Michael:  Um, um, um...


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1229]

Josh: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
Josh: Pretty good.
Michael: Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1230]

Michael: I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1231]

Jim: It's really good to see you, man.
Michael: Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Dwight: Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Jim: Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
Michael: Hey!
Dwight: Shut up. That's impossible.
Jim: No, it's not. I did. Yep.
Dwight: Well, I did it too.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1232]

Josh: Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
Michael: Ah.
Josh: And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
Jan: Oh, hey!
Dwight: Hey, Jan.
Jan: We all checked in?
Josh: Yes.
Jan: Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
Josh: Okay.
Jan: Okay!
Michael: Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
Jan: What are you talking about?
Michael: The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
Jan: Step away from me, Michael.
Michael: Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1233]

Dwight: This party is going to be awesome.
Michael: I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
Dwight: Check it out.
Michael: That is crooked on that side.
Dwight: Wow.
Michael: Hey hey!
Jim: That is a lot of liquor.
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: And a dart board.
Michael: Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
Josh: We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.
Michael: Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
Josh: A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.
Jim: Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
Michael: Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Josh: Um, we should...
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
Dwight: I'll do a shot, Michael.
Michael: Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1234]

Michael: SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1235]

Michael: Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
Jerome Bettis: All right.
Dwight: I'm a huge fan.
Jerome Bettis: Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.
Michael: You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
Jerome Bettis: All right, maybe. If I can.
Michael: Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?
Jerome Bettis: No, you cannot.
Michael: So maybe. See ya.
Dwight: Why do they call him The Bus?
Michael: Because he's afraid to fly.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1236]

Dwight: Smile!
Michael: Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1237]

Josh: All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.
Michael: Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
Dwight: You don't have email on your phone.
Michael: I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
Dwight: No one just called you.
Josh: All right.
Jim: All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Ted: I'll see you soon.
Josh: Yeah, stop by later.
Michael:  See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please?


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1238]

Michael: I need you to do something for me.
Dwight: Yes. Anything.
Michael: I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
Dwight: I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1239]

Dwight: So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
Michael: And?
Dwight: He wasn't volunteering today.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1240]

Michael: Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
Jim: Oh yeah?
Michael: Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
Jim: Oh, tell him I say hi.
Michael: I will call him later with that message.
Jim: Hey, how is... Toby?
Michael: Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Jim: Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
Michael: Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
Jim: Michael, it's really not a competition.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1241]

Josh: Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
Jan: Great!
Michael: Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
Dwight: Whoa. Michael.
Waiter: Wow, oh my God, thank you.
Michael: You're welcome.
Dwight: Was that your per diem?
Michael: No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
Jan: What have you generated, Michael?
Michael: I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
Jan: What party?
Michael: The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Jan: Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1242]

Angela: Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
Michael: Any messages for 308? All right.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1243]

Michael: Hey hey, fellers.
Jim: Michael.
Dwight: Hey, Michael.
Michael: What's up?
Josh: Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
Michael: Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
Josh: I don't think so.
Michael: Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
Josh: Fine! All right.
Michael: Okay! Excellent. Oh...
Dwight: Keep the wing flaps.
Michael: Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!
Jim, Josh, and Dwight: Hi, Pam.
Michael: Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1244]

Michael: You first.
Dwight: Come on. Nice try, Josh!
Michael: Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
Josh: Or what?  We didn't bet anything, Michael.
Michael: Well, let's...
Josh: Yeah, we should go.
Michael: Come on!
Josh: We gotta go.
Michael: Come on!
Josh: Uh... we'll do it later.
Evan: Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line?
Michael: Fine.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1245]

Michael: Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
Evan: That is so true. Ready?
Michael: Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Evan: Great.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1246]

Michael: Sorry, my meeting ran late.
Jan: Really?
Michael: Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
Josh: They're exclusive with Staples.
Michael: Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
Dwight: Yes! Ha!
Jan: Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
Michael: Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1247]

Michael: Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
Guy: I thought there was a party in here.
Michael: This is the party.
Guy: This is room 308?
Michael: Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1248]

Jim: Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
Michael: People have been filtering in and out.
Jim: Can I get a drink?
Michael: What?
Jim: Can I get a drink?
Michael: Sure. You like Cosmos?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
Jim: Michael...
Michael: I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
Jim: Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
Michael: I'm not better than Josh.
Jim: Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
Michael: Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
Jim: No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Michael: I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
Jim: Nope, that's okay.
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: That's all right.
Michael: I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
Jim: Yeah. Okay, maybe.
Evan: Are we early?
Michael: Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Evan, this is Jim.
Jim: How are you?
Evan: Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim.
Michael: Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
Evan: Do you guys work together?
Jim: No, we used to. Now we're friends.
Michael: Best friends.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1249]

Michael: Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1250]

Michael: Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha.
Dwight: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Michael: Whoa. What are those stains?
Dwight: Blood, urine, or semen.
Michael: Oh, God, I hope it's urine.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1251]

Michael: Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention.  Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1252]

Michael:  Ah.
Angela: Sign.
Michael: Per-diem.  Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm!  You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.
Ryan:  Fun jeans.
Michael:  Right there.
Ryan: Fourth quarter projections for Jan?
Michael: Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
Ryan: Will do.
Michael: Sure you don't want to come?
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.
Ryan: 


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1253]

Michael: A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. 'Connecticut.' And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And  Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar.  I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1254]

Michael: See that factory?
Dwight: Mm-hm.
Michael: I almost worked there.
Dwight: No!
Michael: Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.
Dwight: What would you have done? Been manager?
Michael: I was going to be a bottle capper.
Dwight: You? A bottle capper?! 
Michael: I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.


[Date: September 29, 2006, Session #1255]

Michael: Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the...  He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1256]

Michael:  Ahhhhhhhhh.  I'm hungry.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1257]

Michael: Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1258]

Michael: Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Dwight:  Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
Michael: Alright, everybody here?  Yes.
Pam:  Popcorn anyone?
Michael: Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
Pam:  Anyone else?  Nooo.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1259]

Michael: Entourage!


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1260]

Michael: Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
Kevin: Yes!
Dwight: Why him?
Michael: Don't whine.  Get the window. 


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1261]

Michael: Previously on Varsity Blues...
Kevin: Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1262]

Michael:  Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1263]

Jan: How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?
Michael: People work faster after...
Jan: Magically?
Michael: No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
Jan: No.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1264]

Dwight:  I'm going... to the dentist.
Michael: Ok.
Dwight: I have to have an emergency crown put in.
Michael: Ouchy.
Dwight: Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
Michael: Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1265]

Jan:  Michael.
Michael: Hi.
Jan: I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
Michael: Oh.  That's nice.
Jan: No, it wasn't.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
Michael: ...what?
Jan: Mm-hmm.
Michael: ...you were at the dentist?
Jan: You can't have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.
Michael: Ok.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1266]

Michael: What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She's my ex-lover!  ...ish.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1267]

Michael: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: Hey.
Michael: Do you want an M&M?
Dwight: No thanks I'm stuffed.
Michael: No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.
Dwight: ...ok. 
Michael: They're good, huh?
Dwight: ...so good.
Michael: Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
Dwight: They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
Michael: Sounds like a good dentist.
Dwight: Oh, yeah.
Michael: What's his name?
Dwight:  Crentist.
Michael: Your dentist's name is Crentist.
Dwight: Yep.
Michael: Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
Dwight: Maybe that's why he became a dentist.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1268]

Michael: Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em.
Dwight:   Ahh.  Aaaah.
Michael: You should... floss.
Dwight: I know...
Michael:  Well then... I am glad you're ok.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1269]

Michael: Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?   Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1270]

Michael: Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1271]

Michael:  Wow, this is tough.
Dwight: What?
Michael: Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh!
Dwight: What is it?
Michael: Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
Dwight: No.
Michael: Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
Dwight: Gahh!
Michael: And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Dwight: I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.
Michael: I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.
Dwight: You said that?
Michael: Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
Dwight: Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
Michael:  Perfect, well, we're settled.
Dwight: All right.
Michael: All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
Dwight: Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
Michael: Ohh..
Dwight: Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Michael:  Can't you?  That's so nice.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1272]

Michael: Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
Dwight: Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.  Ok let's do it.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1273]

Michael: Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
Phyllis: You're kidding...
Michael: You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
Angela: Congratulations Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you Angela.
Stanley: But... why Dwight?
Michael: Because, Dwight... never lies.
Stanley: How does that qualify him to run a branch?
Michael: Because that's all it takes.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1274]

Michael: Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
Dwight: Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1275]

Phyllis: Michael, what will you do?
Michael: Oh, I'll be fine.
Kevin: Do you have any savings?
Michael: No, no, I don't, but---
Kevin: Michael, you might lose your condo.
Michael: I... won't.   I won't.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1276]

Michael: Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
Dwight:  No thank you.
Michael: It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
Dwight: No thanks.
Michael: What?
Dwight: Not my style.
Michael: But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it.
Dwight: Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Michael:  Take it back.
Dwight:  No.
Michael: That's my car.
Dwight: What did you---
Michael: THAT'S MY CAR.
Dwight: Yes.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1277]

Michael: I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
Dwight: You know what?
Michael: Jan called me about your little meeting!
Dwight: No!
Michael: I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
Dwight: I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Michael: Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
Dwight:  Don't fire me.  Please.
Michael: Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
Dwight:  I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
Michael: Not.  Good.  Enough!
Dwight:  I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
Michael: I have a laundry machine!
Dwight: I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. 
Michael: I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
Dwight: You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?    What can I do?   What can I do?  What can I do?
Michael: You can get up.  Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.  


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1278]

Michael: Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1279]

Michael: Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1280]

Michael: Okay. 
Dwight: Hey.  Is everything okay?
Michael: It is not your business, Dwight.
Dwight: If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Michael: What do you know about management, Dwight?
Dwight: I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
Michael: I'm not firing anyone.
Dwight: Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
Michael: ... What?


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1281]

Michael: Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there.  Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go.
Stanley:  I'm on the phone.
Michael: Ryan?
Ryan: I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
Michael: Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.
Dwight: 
Angela: 


[Date: October 5, 2006, Session #1282]

Michael: So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... 
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you.  It's Jan for you.
Michael: Really?
Pam: Yeah.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1283]

Michael: Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
Ryan: Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
Michael: Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
Ryan: Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
Michael: All right, I'll be right back. 
Dwight:  Whoo!
Michael:   There you go.
Dwight: Awesome!
Ryan: Thank you.
Michael: You're welcome.
Dwight: Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
Michael: Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  
Dwight: Okay.  Whoo!
Michael: There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
Pam: Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
Michael: There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
Pam: But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
Ryan and others: Yeah.  Yes, it's better.  It's great.
Michael:  All right.  Okay. 


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1284]

Michael: I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1285]

Pam:  With cream and sugar?
Michael:  All right.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1286]

Jan:  So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
Michael: Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?
Jan: Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
Michael: Oh, wow.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1287]

Michael: Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.
Kelly: Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.
Michael: Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss.
Phyllis: That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Michael: That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1288]

Michael: So did you hear the news?
Pam: The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: Is there anything I can do?
Michael: Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: 
Pam: Oh.  Okay.
Michael: Yeah.  Mmmmmm.
Pam:  Okay.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1289]

Creed: It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
Michael: Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'.
Creed: About what?
Michael: The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.
Creed: Ed was decapitated.
Michael: What?
Dwight: Really?
Creed: He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
Michael: Oh my God.
Dwight: That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
Creed: You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
Dwight: You're thinking of a chicken.
Creed: What did I say?


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1290]

Michael: That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1291]

Michael:  So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
Dwight: Ed was decapitated.
Michael: What are you doing?
Dwight: You said you didn't know how to say it.
Michael: I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1292]

Michael: I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
Jan:  I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
Michael: You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
Jan: Well, what would you suggest?
Michael:  A statue.
Jan: Of Ed?
Michael: Yeah.
Jan:  I'm not sure that's realistic.
Michael: Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
Jan: No, that's not---
Michael: We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
Dwight: That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Michael: I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Dwight: And how big do you want this robot?
Michael: Life-size.
Dwight: Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
Jan: What the hell are you two talking about?
Michael: Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
Jan: You know what, Michael?  I've really tried with you today...
Michael: Mm hm.
Jan: ...and I have to get back to work.
Michael: Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
Jan: So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
Michael: But Ed truck can't because he is---
Jan: Goodbye. 
Michael: DEAD.
Dwight: Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Michael: That's perfect.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1293]

Michael: Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.
Phyllis: Okay that's enough.
Michael: What?
Stanley: We do not wanna hear about this.
Michael: Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
Stanley: You have just spit on my face.
Michael: Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1294]

Michael: There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1295]

Michael: I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
Roy: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
Michael: Okay, fine.  Hurry back.
Roy:  There's nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the 'grief counseling' session.
Pam: Oh.  I would like a break.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1296]

Michael:  Okay, we can start.  Um...
Pam: You waited for me?
Michael: Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
Dwight:  I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
Michael: Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
Stanley:  Nope.
Michael:  Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
Stanley: I will NOT. 
Michael: Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Pam: Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
Michael: Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay.
Ryan:   Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
Michael: Do you want to talk about it anymore?
Ryan: Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
Kevin: Me, me, me, me, me me.   Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Michael: Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game?
Phyllis: Well, there is a ball.
Michael: All right, we're starting over.
Stanley: No, I'm done.
Michael: You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
Angela: We really have a lot of work to do right now.
Michael: Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. 
Toby: Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.
Michael: How do you know?
Toby: What?
Michael: That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
Toby: It was obvious...
Michael: Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! 
Dwight: Michael!  Michael.   Michael ...
Michael:  Oh, God!
Dwight:  Oh...
Michael: Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...
Dwight: Poor little fella.
Michael: Oh shhhh--oot!
Dwight: He is a goner.
Michael: No, he's not.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: No, he's not. 
Dwight: Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
Michael: Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1297]

Angela: A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
Michael: We don't know if it's dead.
Kelly: Ugh, no that thing is
Dwight: You want me to flush him?


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1298]

Michael: Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
Meredith: I have a lot of work to do.
Michael: Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
Angela: But...
Michael: No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1299]

Kelly: 
Michael: It's okay.  It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
Kelly: I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan  for him to know that we have a date tonight?


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1300]

Dwight:  Argh... gah!
Michael: What are... What are you doing?
Dwight: What?  No, this is about the right size.
Michael: No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1301]

Michael: Glad you could all make it.
Kelly: You told us we had to.
Michael: Dwight, do you have the box?
Pam: Actually, I have it.
Michael: You made this?  Wow.  That's... that's very nice.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1302]

Pam: I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
Kevin: Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Pam: And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
Dwight: He's not a songbird.
Michael: Shhh.
Pam: An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.
Angela:  Amen.
Dwight: 
Pam:  Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1303]

Michael: Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1304]

Jan:  Ed Truck died over the weekend.
Michael: Oh, wow. He...
Jan: Yeah. And I know... I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.
Michael: Does his family know?
Jan: Yes, they know, Michael.
Michael: But I'm the first in the office?
Jan: I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.
Michael: Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...
Jan: Good.
Michael: ...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? 


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1305]

Michael: Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1306]

Michael: I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.
Kevin: ...ces. 
Michael: What was that, Kevin?
Kevin: Nothing.
Michael: No, you said something, didn't you?
Kevin: May he rest in pieces.  You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
Michael: You think that's funny.
Kevin: No. 
Michael: You are disgusting.
Dwight: Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
Michael: No, that can't be right.
Toby: Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now.
Michael: Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1307]

Toby: Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to.
Kevin: Not really.
Michael: You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1308]

Toby: Is anyone having any trouble eating?
Kevin: No.
Toby: Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?
Stanley: I'm having trouble getting my work done today.
Toby: Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk.
Michael: Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.
Toby: Michael, I'm sorry...
Michael: No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1309]

Michael: I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1310]

Michael: Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
Angela: Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1311]

Michael: I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1312]

Michael: 


[Date: October 12, 2006, Session #1313]

Michael: That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there.  Just dig.
Dwight: Ow! God!
Michael: Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. 
Man: Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?
Michael: Nothing. Let's just... all right.  Guys, do you have a box we could use?

[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1314]

Jan: Tell me what you did yesterday.
Michael: Uhhh... nothing.
Jan: Nothing?
Michael: Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
Jan: I don't care how your day was Michael.
Michael: Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
Jan: Tell me what you did yesterday.
Michael: I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1315]

Michael: Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1316]

Michael: Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1317]

Michael: Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1318]

Michael:  Oh, shhh... Come on.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1319]

Kelly: Because they acted all tough and everything...
Michael: Uh huh.
Kelly: But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
Michael:  Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
Phyllis: I'm just saying hi to Bob.
Michael: No, I think you're cutting in line.
Bob: Well settle down, Scott.
Michael: No, I'm not going to settle down.
Stanley: No way.
Michael: Get in the back please.
Stanley: Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
Michael: Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right.
Bob: What a pair of Mary's.
Stanley: This is Pretzel Day.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1320]

Pam: Michael.
Michael: No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.
Pam: Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Michael: I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
Pam: Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
Michael: Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
Pam: You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
Michael: Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1321]

Stanley: Thank you! 
Michael: Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Pretzel guy: We do.
Michael: Thank God.
Pretzel guy: And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar.
Michael: Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
Pretzel guy: The Works. You got it.
Michael: All right! Thank you!


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1322]

Kevin:  Hey! Hey!
Michael: Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1323]

Michael: Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
Toby: Second?
Michael: Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
Kevin: Account...? Michael, what is going on?
Michael: And I will be taking questions.
Pam: Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
Phyllis: What's on your suit?
Michael: Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1324]

Kevin: Night, Pam.
Pam: Night.
Michael: Hey, what time is it?
Pam: 20 past 5.
Michael: AM or PM?
Pam: PM.
Michael: Oh, good.
Pam: These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
Michael: Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
Pam: This is a huge sale.
Michael: Yes. Right. Good.
Pam: Night, Michael.
Michael: Goodnight!
Pam:  Dunder Mifflin.
Jim: Ah, hey.
Pam: Oh my God.
Jim: Hi.
Pam: Hi.
Jim: Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
Pam: Oh.
Jim: And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Pam: I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Jim: Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
Pam: Yeah, totally. So...
Jim: So...
Pam: Do you...
Jim: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Pam: Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
Jim: Oh, good.
Pam: A little different. What time is it there?
Jim: What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
Pam: Oh, yeah. Right.
Jim: How far away did you think we were?
Pam: I don't know. It felt far.
Jim: Yeah. I have a question for you.
Pam: What?
Jim: How many words per minute does the average person type?
Pam: I type 90.
Jim: Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
Pam: It's true.
Jim: Ok, I said average.
Pam: 70? How many do you type?
Jim: Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
Pam: Come on. Tell me.
Jim: No.
Pam: You have to tell me now.
Jim: 65. Ok, no need to laugh.
Pam: No, it's, that's respectable.
Jim: Respectable?


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1325]

Jan: What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.
Michael: Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.
Jan: Zoning out?
Michael: Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.
Jan: If you can account for your time...
Michael: Yes, big if.
Jan: ...then maybe corporate can justify your salary.
Michael: A woman spurned.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1326]

Dwight: Take a good look at this boy...
Michael: I always do.
Dwight: ...because you are never going to see him again.
Michael: If you lay a finger...
Dwight: Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
Michael: Would you look at that?   Damn it, Dwight! Come on.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1327]

Michael: 9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page.
Pam: Hey, let's focus today. Make today all about focus. I'll help you.
Michael: Okay. That sounds good.   Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that.
Pam: Yeah.


[Date: October 19, 2006, Session #1328]

Michael: What makes them so good?
Stanley: I do not know.
Michael: I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.
Stanley: That's what she said. 


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1329]

Kelly: Here you go.
Michael: Nice dress, Ryan.
Kelly: It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
Michael:  OK.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1330]

Michael: Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1331]

Kelly: You look so handsome.
Pam: Really you do. I love the material.
Kelly: I know.
Michael: How come you didn't get me one?
Kelly: I...


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1332]

Kevin: Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Roy: I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
Kevin: Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
Angela: Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
Michael: Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1333]

Michael: It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
Stanley: I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Michael: Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1334]

Michael: I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1335]

Michael: Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
Kelly: Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
Michael: Kelly?
Kelly: Sparkles...
Michael: Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
Kelly: Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Angela: How many gods do you have?
Kelly: Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Angela:  And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
Kevin: She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Dwight: Pam wishes.  Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Michael: All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1336]

Michael: Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '
Dwight: I see dead people.
Michael: Okay. Spoiler... alert.
Dwight: He was dead the whole time.
Michael: Just stop it.  What's the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from?


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1337]

Michael: And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
Creed: I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Meredith: Oh, that's what they call it.
Kevin: This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Michael: Thank you, Kevin.
Angela: I find this incredibly offensive.
Michael: Well, I find it beautiful.
Angela: Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
Michael: No...
Toby: Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
Michael: No, You're not going to collect them.
Toby: Yes.
Michael: No. This is delightful, charming culture.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1338]

Michael: My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1339]

Carol:  I thought you said this was a costume party!
Michael:  What does that look like to you?
Carol: An Indian woman in a sari.
Michael: No one's even going to notice.
Kevin: Nice outfit.
Michael: Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1340]

Michael: I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
Angela: I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
Server: It's all vegetarian.
Angela: I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1341]

Michael: Oh, yuck. 
Carol: What? Too spicy?
Michael: No. These s'mores are disgusting.
Carol: They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Michael: Do you think they have any s'mores?


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1342]

Michael: All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1343]

Michael: Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
Kelly's Father: Yes.
Michael: Wow.
Kelly's Father: How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Michael: Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
Kelly's Mom: She is very fair.
Michael: She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1344]

Carol: Are you okay?
Michael: I'm going to be.  Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
Crowd: Awww!
Carol: Oh, Michael.
Michael: What do you say?
Carol: Can we talk about this in private?
Michael: I didn't hear you. 
Carol:  Can we talk about this in private?
Michael:  Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1345]

Michael: No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
Carol: This is the ninth date, Michael.
Michael: Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
Carol: I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
Michael: Yes.
Carol: Okay.
Michael: Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
Carol: Okay, good night, Michael.
Michael: All right. Good night.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1346]

Michael: Oh, God!  Oh. Wow.
Pam: Here. 
Michael: That's so spicy.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Oh. You waiting for a call?
Pam: Uh... no.
Michael: Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
Pam: Well, you were never really engaged.
Michael: I was in that marriage arena, though.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
Pam: I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
Michael: We're so alike. So alike. 
Pam: What are you doing?
Michael: What are you doing?
Pam: I'm rejecting your...
Michael: I'm... what? I didn't
Pam: ...kiss.
Michael:  Can I have a ride home?
Pam: If you sit in the back.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1347]

Michael: These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
Pam: You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
Michael: Sorry.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1348]

Michael: This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
Crowd: 


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1349]

Michael: How do I explain this to Jan?
Kelly: Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
Michael: Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
Kelly: Like, an Indian Halloween?
Michael: An Indian Halloween. Okay, great.  Pam, could you put Jan on, please?
Pam:  Michael, you're on with Jan.
Michael: Hello, Jan.
Jan: Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Michael: Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.
Jan: What is Diwali?
Michael: What is Diwali?
Jan: Yes.
Michael: You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---
Jan: Mich---
Michael: #NAME?
Jan: Oh.
Michael: I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...
Kelly: Um, customer service.
Michael: ... customer service is a Hindu person.
Jan: Oh.
Michael: And.
Jan: Yes, of course, I know Kelly.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: I thought she was Muslim.
Kelly: What? I'm not Muslim!
Jan: Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
Michael: You do?
Jan: Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Michael: Oh, I dunno about that.
Jan: #NAME?
Michael: For Kelly, that seems a bit much.
Jan: Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
Michael: 
Kelly: She's so wonderful.
Michael: Yeah, you should see her naked.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1350]

Michael: I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.'  And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...'  ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh...  So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.


[Date: November 2, 2006, Session #1351]

Michael: And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: Your shirt is buttoned wrong.
Michael: So, any questions?

[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1352]

Michael: There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
Jan: Michael.
Michael: ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
Jan: Michael.
Michael:  Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Jan: I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
Michael: I don't understand.
Jan: The board voted last night to close your branch.
Michael: On whom's authority?
Jan: The board's.
Michael: What?
Jan: I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
Michael: You're welcome.
Jan: A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
Michael: Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
Jan: Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
Michael: Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
Jan: Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
Michael: Well...
Jan: It's... it's about talent.
Michael: Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
Jan: Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
Michael: Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1353]

Michael: It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1354]

Michael: Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1355]

Dwight: Hey stranger.
Michael: Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Dwight: Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
Michael: Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1356]

Pam: Are you okay?
Michael: Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
Pam: What did Jan want?
Michael: Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
Pam: What can't you tell me?
Michael: Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
Pam: What?!
Michael: What?
Pam: You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
Michael: Do I have any messages?
Pam: Michael, what's going on?
Michael: Ok, ok...


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1357]

Michael:  Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
Toby: Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
Michael: You knew about this all along, didn't you?
Toby: Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
Michael: Traitor. You are a traitor.
Angela: What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Michael: I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1358]

Darryl: Hey Mike.
Michael: Darryl. Noble Darryl. 
Darryl: Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
Michael: I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
Darryl: I wasn't.
Michael: So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
Darryl: Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
Michael: Awesome.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1359]

Michael: This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1360]

Michael: All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Let's go.
Dwight: Yes!
Pam: Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.
Michael: Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1361]

Dwight: What's the plan?
Michael: Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
Dwight: Can I drive?
Michael: No... way.
Dwight: Shotgun!
Michael: No. There's no one else.
Dwight: Still.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1362]

Dwight: Thank you very much.  Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
Michael: Okay, okay. Um...
Dwight: But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here.
Michael: Why?
Dwight: Christmas card list.
Michael: You sent him cards? You never met him.
Dwight: But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1363]

Michael: Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1364]

Dwight: So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
Michael: I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
Dwight: No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Michael: All right.
Dwight:  Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
M ichael: Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
Dwight: Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Michael : Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
Dwight: Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Michael: Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
Dwight: Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Michael:  Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Dwight:  Whoa hey, why not?
Michael: Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: Don't touch me this time.
Dwight:  Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Michael: Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
Dwight:  Uh!


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1365]

Dwight: Ah.  Here, replinish your fluids.
Michael: 


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1366]

Dwight:  who is it?
Michael: The office.
Dwight: Gonna get it?
Michael: No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1367]

Michael: Anything?
Dwight: Nothing. 
Michael: What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
Dwight: Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Michael:  All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
Dwight: My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Michael: That was hilarious. The foam ...
Dwight: Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Michael: Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
Dwight: What were your favorite moments?
Michael: Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
Dwight: What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Michael: God, Dwight!
Dwight: Well, it doesn't...


[Date: November 9, 2006, Session #1368]

Michael: What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
Dwight: 
Michael: Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
Dwight:  Oh my God!
Michael: What?!
Dwight: Stamford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.
Michael: We did it? We did it.
Dwight: We did it!
Michael and Dwight: We did it! We did it!
Michael: Right here! Right here! 
Michael and Dwight: Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu!
Michael: Yeah, baby!
Dwight: In your face!
Michael: We did it!
Dwight: Oh, man.
Michael: How did we do it?
Dwight: I don't ... have no idea.
Michael: I don't understand.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1369]

Michael: Here... Who's here?
Dwight: Nametag?
Michael: Yes, please.
Dwight: Karen Filippelli.
Michael: Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Dwight: Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1370]

Michael: My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. 


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1371]

Michael: Who's next?
Dwight: That's Andy Bernard.
Michael: Andy Bernard.
Dwight: If I were you...
Michael: Saint Bernard.
Dwight: ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Michael: What?
Dwight: ...before noon...
Michael: I'm not...
Dwight: ...to consolidate power.
Michael: I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Dwight: No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1372]

Pam: Good morning!
Michael: Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
Pam: Okay.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1373]

Hannah: Hello?
Michael: Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Dwight: Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Michael: Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1374]

Michael: You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as I'm concerned,  this says 'World's Best Dad'.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1375]

Michael: Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Tony: Gardner.
Michael: Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
Tony: Thanks.
Kevin: Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
Michael: Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Hannah: My bag's mostly pencils.
Michael: Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Kevin: Can I have your pencils?
Hannah: No.
Pam: Hi!
Karen: Hi.
Pam: I'm Pam.
Karen: Karen. I love your sweater.
Pam: Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Karen: Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Michael: Welcome.
Karen: ...to knit.
Michael: Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Karen: Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Michael: Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1376]

Andy: Hello.
Michael: Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
Andy: And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Michael: A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Andy: Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
Michael: Oh.
Andy: Nifty!
Michael: They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1377]

Michael: You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1378]

Martin: ...which is why they need a passing game.
Jim: Right.
Michael:  No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
Jim: Okay.
Michael:  How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Martin: Oh! Thanks.
Michael: Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is...
Jim: Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Pam: Oh my god! It's really you!
Jim: Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Pam: I know. I don't care.
Jim: Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Pam: It's really good to see you.
Jim: You, too.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1379]

Andy: Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Michael: Right.
Dwight: Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Andy: Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Dwight: So you'll be reporting to me, then.
Andy: Umm, on the contrary.
Dwight: My title has 'Manager' in it.
Andy: And I'm a director.
Dwight: Oh.
Andy: Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Dwight: I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Andy: Congratulations.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1380]

Michael:  I present the orientation video.
Dwight: We need to talk!
Michael: Not now.
Dwight: Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Michael: I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Dwight: Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Michael: It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
Dwight: Ok. Who reports to who?
Michael: I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Dwight: And then if I want...
Michael: Work it out amongst your selves!
Dwight: I...
Michael: Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
Dwight: I...
Michael: Will you?
Dwight: One...
Michael: Please?


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1381]

Michael: Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1382]

Michael: Yoko shack.
Male voice: ...thank you James. 
Meredith: Hey, champagne.
Michael: Nope, no. Guests only.
Kelly: Looks like salmon.
Michael: Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Kelly: I eat beef.
Michael: Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Kevin: The beef is poisoned?
Michael: No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
Toby: Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Michael: Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Jim: Oh, this looks promising.
Pam: You won't be disappointed.
Michael: Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1383]

Video: 
Michael: Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Dwight: Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Michael: So check out how we live
Michael & Dwight: in the Electric City!
Michael: They call it Scranton.
Dwight: What?
Michael: The Electric City. Scranton.
Dwight: What?
Michael: The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
Dwight: But check that it's covered by your health care provider!


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1384]

Michael:  I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1385]

Video: 
Michael: You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Dwight: But the little cars go in the compact spot
Michael and Dwight: Spot, spot, spot, spot ...


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1386]

Michael:  Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Michael: Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1387]

Pam: Hey.
Jim: Hey!
Pam: What happened to grape soda?
Jim: Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Pam: Oh. You've changed so much.
Jim: Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Pam: So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Jim: Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Pam: Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
Jim: Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
Michael: All right.
Jim: Don't...
Michael: Okay.
Jim: All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Pam: Yeah. I know, me too.
Jim: All right!


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1388]

Hannah: Look what's on his computer.
Michael: What is that? A squid's eye or...
Hannah: It's my left breast.
Michael: How did you...
Creed: Right place at the right time.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1389]

Michael: People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1390]

Michael: I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Dwight: Do you have batteries?
Michael: Ssshh stupid! Um...
Andy: 
Michael: That's it!
Andy:  What is love?
Michael: Yes, yes! Okay!
Andy: Baby, don't hurt me.
Michael: Okay, here we go.
Andy & Michael: Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!
Michael: Oh!
Andy: Baby, don't hurt me!
Michael: Oh! Oh! Oh!
Andy: Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Michael: Scuse me! Scuse me!
Andy & Michael: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...
Michael: You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Andy: Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Michael: You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
Andy: Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
Michael:  Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Dwight: Very funny, Michael!
Michael: Okay! Okay!
Dwight: Really funny, Michael!
Michael: All right, all right, I'm on a roll.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1391]

Michael: Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Karen: Shouldn't we be equals?
Michael: Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
Tony: Uh... this is difficult, for me.
Michael: I understand. We're all friends.
Tony: No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.
Michael: Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Tony: 
Michael: You know what? I'll help. I will...
Tony: No, please. No.
Michael: Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
Dwight: Do this. Come on. Ready?
Michael: Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Dwight: On three. One... two... three.
Michael: Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
Tony: All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
Michael: We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
Tony: Let me go!
Michael: I'm right in your crack!
Tony: Put me down right...
Michael: Up and over.
Tony: Put me down!
Michael: Up and over.
Tony: Put me down right now!
Michael: You've got it.
Tony: I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
Michael: You've got it, you've got it.
Tony: PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
Michael: Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Dwight: Hey, hey. Easy.
Michael: Easy.
Tony: I'm sorry!
Michael: Don't...
Tony: It's just not going to work for me.
Michael: What...
Tony: I have to go.
Michael: I don't understand.
Tony: I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.
Michael: Well, we'll squeeze you in.
Tony: I can't work here. I have to quit.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1392]

Michael: You can't quit! On the first day. That's  heresy, my friend!  Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
Tony: No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
Michael: My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
Tony: No. Was it supposed to be funny?
Michael: Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
Tony: Excuse me?
Michael: You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
Tony: But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
Michael: Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Dwight: That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
Michael: Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
Dwight: And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1393]

Hannah: Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
Angela: Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Michael: Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
Stanley: Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Michael: No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1394]

Michael: The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1395]

Michael: Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Dwight: What!
Michael: Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Karen: Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Jim: Does he ever.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1396]

Michael: Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
Dwight: YEAH!
Michael: Yeah.
Toby: I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Michael: Go home, Toby. Just...
Martin: Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
Michael: Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!'
Hannah: For crying out loud.
Michael: No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
Martin:  What's up with this guy?
Stanley: Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Michael: THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1397]

Michael: See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!
Jan: Michael!
Michael: Hi, Jan!
Jan: Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Michael: I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Jan: Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Michael: Yes.
Jan: You do?
Michael: But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Jan: What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Michael: What?
Jan: He's the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Michael: Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1398]

Michael: So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Dwight: If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Jim: Yeah, it does, actually.
Dwight: So who will be your new Number Three?
Michael: Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Andy: Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Michael: Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
Dwight: And I have to say your leadership...
Michael: Shut it...
Dwight: has brought...
Michael: Shut it! That's...  suck up!


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1399]

Michael: And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack.
Dwight: Nash.
Michael: Martin Nash. Okay.
Dwight: Male, age 37...
Michael: Good.
Dwight: Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
Michael: What are you talking about?
Dwight:  It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
Michael: All right, just...


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1400]

Andy:  Hi, Andy Bernard.
Kevin: Kevin Malone.
Andy: Nice to meet you.
Kevin: What's that on your shirt? 
Andy: That is a penguin. You like it?
Kevin: The Penguin.
Andy: Andy, or Andrew.
Kevin: Okay, Penguin. 
Michael: Smiles.
Andy: Yeah.
Michael: Good, what's funny?
Kevin: Michael, have you met the Penguin?
Michael: Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.
Andy: Ha, that's why I wore this shirt.
Michael: Good.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1401]

Michael: Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1402]

Michael: Can't we all get along?  No, we can't. But here's the thing: yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences?  No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can't. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1403]

Michael: I need somebody to pick a card.  One of the new people, please? Tony? 
Andy:  I'll do it.
Michael: All right. Good. Thank you.  Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here . So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.
Andy:  King of hearts.
Dwight:  Very good Michael. Really good. 
Michael: So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be  a king of hearts.
Andy:  That was fantastic.
Dwight:  No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
Michael: Dwight, don't, don't be a suck up.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1404]

Michael: What I want all of you  to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?
Meredith:  I want to.
Michael: Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot.
Meredith:  I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
Martin: Thank you.
Michael:  Beautiful. Very good, nice.


[Date: November 16, 2006, Session #1405]

Andy: It is inspiring to me to watch you navigate these murky waters.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Bull...   Sorry.
Michael: We heard it.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.
Dwight: I had a tickle in my throat.
Michael:  They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right?
Dwight: I can't say ?
Michael:  Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
Dwight: Sometimes it hurts Michael.
Michael:  You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!

[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1406]

Pam: Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
Hannah: He.
Pam: ...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.
Hannah: That's his favorite color.
Pam: ...Oh. That's... fun for him.
Stanley: Fantastic.
Michael: Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
Hannah: Thank youuu.
Michael: Ohh. May I?
Hannah: Uh, sure!
Michael:  Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from 'Look Who's Talking.' What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1407]

Michael: Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.
Angela: Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
Jan:  Mmhmm.
Angela: Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
Jan: We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
Michael: I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding.
Jan: When did the check come?
Angela: Last week.
Jan: Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
Angela: One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
Michael: Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
Angela: Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
Jan: Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
Pam:  Who is it?
Michael: Hannah?
Kevin: Hmm.
Angela: Hmm.
Kevin: Andy.
Angela: Andy?
Kevin: Hmm. Martin?
Michael: Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
Kevin: Wait, why am I a racist?
Michael: Because you think he's black.
Kevin: He is black... right? And...
Michael: Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
Jan: ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
Kevin: Yeah!
Jan: Michael?


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1408]

Michael: Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1409]

Kevin: I wonder what he did.
Michael: In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
Pam: Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Michael: Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Kevin: Cool.
Pam: Okay. Angela?
Angela: Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
Michael: Good. All right. 


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1410]

Michael: Just... try to be cool.
Dwight: I am cool.
Michael: Okay, are you cool, really?
Dwight: I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Michael: Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1411]

Michael: Hey Martin, how's it going?
Martin: Good. Getting settled, you know?
Michael: Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
Pam: My dad.
Michael: ...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
Jim: Jonas Salk.
Michael: Who?
Jim: Justin Timberlake?
Michael: Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
Karen: Hey I got one.
Michael: Yup.
Karen: Jesus.
Michael: Apollo Creed.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1412]

Michael: Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1413]

Martin: So... you all wanna know what I was in for?
Michael: No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
Martin: Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.
Michael:  That is awesome.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1414]

Pam: What was prison like?
Martin: Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.
Kevin: You got outdoors time?
Martin: Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games...
Kevin: Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?
Pam: Yeah, some days I never go outside.
Michael: Well, we are running a business, so.
Meredith: What was your cell like?
Martin: Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes.
Pam: They have art classes?
Martin: Yeap. Yeah.
Ryan: They have business classes there?
Martin: They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business.
Pam: Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
Michael: Ah. Well. That's not true.
Kevin: I would so rather be in prison.
Ryan: Prison sounds great.
Michael: No you would not.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1415]

Michael: This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1416]

Michael: Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1417]

Pam: Michael, it's freezing out.
Phyllis: I can't feel my toes.
Michael: Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
Jim: What is that, like... five pounds?
Michael: It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
Stanley: I'm going back inside.
Michael: Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1418]

Michael: Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
Martin: Yeah, in the rec room.
Michael: Ah. A ten inch black and white?
Martin: Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1419]

Michael: These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1420]

Michael: All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say 'Boo' because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
Angela: Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
Michael: Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
Ryan: Michael, please. 
Jim: Where... did you learn all of this?
Michael: Internet.
Jim: So, not prison.
Michael: And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
Jim: What'd you do, Prison Mike?
Michael: I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
Jim: That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Michael: And I nevah got caught, neither.
Jim: Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
Pam: Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Michael: Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
Andy: Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
Michael: Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Dwight: Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
Angela: Don't encourage him, Dwight.
Michael: The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
Karen: Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
Michael: No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
Pam: Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
Martin: Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison.
Michael: Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. 
Jim: Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
Michael: No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1421]

Toby: Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
Michael: They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Toby: Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
Michael: Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
Toby: You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
Michael:  Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!


[Date: November 30, 2006, Session #1422]

Michael: Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1423]

Pam:  Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Michael: Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
Pam: But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1424]

Michael:  Have you ever seen this woman?
Pam: Her?
Michael: Hmm...
Pam: The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Michael: Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Pam: Or in a great chair.
Michael: Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
Pam: I definitely remember your dinner party.
Michael: I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman.  Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Pam: Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1425]

Michael: What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1426]

Michael: Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. 
Creed:  Yo, is this his new chair?
Pam:  No, he hasn't picked one yet.
Creed:  Daat!


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1427]

Michael: I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1428]

Michael:  Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
Kevin: If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Michael: I thought that you were engaged?
Kevin: Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Michael: Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
Kevin: Not anymore.
Michael: Oh...
Kevin: It's a bitter situation.
Michael: Yeah... ugh. She's...  you don't deserve her. Alright.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1429]

Michael:  Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...
Phyllis: Michael?
Michael: What?
Phyllis: I have a friend who's single.
Michael: Oh.
Phyllis: Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Michael: Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
Phyllis: Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
Michael: Oooo. Catcher or in field?
Phyllis: Umm I don't know Michael.
Michael: Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
Phyllis: What are you asking?
Michael: I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
Phyllis: No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
Michael: Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1430]

Michael: What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1431]

Michael: Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
Angela: I don't think that this is---
Michael: Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
Dwight:  Write legibly people.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1432]

Andy: Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Michael: Hmm..
Andy: It's like a ten minute walk.
Kevin: No, thirty.
Michael: Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad.
Kevin: Yes.
Andy: Yes.
Michael: That would be bad.
Andy: OK.
Kevin: Nice.
Andy: ...So help us out.
Michael: Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
Kevin: Michael, please he--
Michael: What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
Andy: We won't let you down.
Michael: Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen,  don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1433]

Michael: Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. 
Wendy's phone operator: Wendy's.
Michael: Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.
Wendy's phone operator: This isn't Wendy.
Michael: Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
Wendy's phone operator: Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant.
Michael:  Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
Wendy's phone operator: You have to come to the restaurant to order food.
Michael: Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
Wendy's phone operator: It's ready now.
Michael: Well put it aside.   Umm... yeah.
Dwight: OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Michael: Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
Dwight: I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Michael: That sounds good.  Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1434]

Michael: She's dead?  She's so young.
Dwight: She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Michael: Oh, God. Oh...
Dwight: Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on.  Here we go. Yeah.
Jim: Michael, you didn't even know her.
Michael: Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
Dwight: Jim, how dare you. 
Michael: Please, not at a time like this. 
Pam: OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Michael: Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
Pam: No, I mean it.  She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. 
Michael: I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1435]

Michael: No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1436]

Kevin: We need to assemble the five families.
Michael:  No, not the five families.
Kevin: We have to.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1437]

Michael:  Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
Kevin:  I'm calling the meeting anyway.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1438]

Michael:  Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. 
Margaret: Michael?
Michael:  Ugh.
Margaret: Are you Michael Scott?
Michael: Is who a Michael what?
Margaret: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael.
Michael: Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
Coffee shop worker: Michael? Michael?  Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1439]

Michael: So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
Margaret: You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?
Michael: Just making conversation.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1440]

Michael: Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
Margaret: I don't know.
Michael: You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that.
Margaret: She's beautiful.
Michael: Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
Jan : Michael? Hello? Michael? 
Margaret: I'm gonna head out.
Michael: Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
Margaret: That's incredibly rude.
Michael: Now you ruined it. 


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1441]

Michael: Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
Pam: She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
Michael: Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...
Jim:  Margaret?
Pam: I know.
Jim: You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. 
Pam: Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
Jim: Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Pam: Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Jim: OK, sure. Let's do it. 
Pam: No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
Jim: Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Pam: Hmm, I don't, know...
Jim: Oh, well, that's coming. 
Pam: Oh, right now?
Jim: No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Pam: OK, so then, when?
Jim: Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Pam: Oh, right, yeah.
Jim: Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
Pam: Ohh kay.
Jim: And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Pam: I've been warned.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1442]

Michael: I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... 
Dwight: You know what you need? Closure.
Michael: You're right. What do you mean though?
Dwight: There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
Michael: Hmm.
Dwight: Come on. I'll drive.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1443]

Michael:  How did she die?
Dwight: I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
Michael: God.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: She was so innocent.
Dwight: She was stoned apparently.
Michael: You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
Dwight: You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Michael: Oh, you move on.
Dwight: Yeah.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1444]

Michael:  Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off  and die?


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1445]

Michael/Dwight:  OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then  can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym.  'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Michael: Return.
Dwight: Rhythm and blues...
Michael: This'll be  the day that I died.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1446]

Michael: It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um  ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good.
Dwight: Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
Michael: Oh.  What is this?
Dwight: Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
Michael: You were charging me?  I'm your friend.
Dwight: You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
Michael: There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
Dwight: Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
Michael: Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead .
Michael: Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: We don't take debit cards, anyway.
Michael: Dwight, little help with the bags, please.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1447]

Michael: So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?
Angela: I don't.
Michael: A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
Angela: A Catholic schoolgirl?
Michael: No, no, obviously older.
Angela: A nun?


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1448]

Michael: Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1449]

Kelly: Hi, Michael.
Michael:  Hey, Kelly.
Kelly: Yeah, what are you doing here?
Michael: Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
Kelly: Oh, all my friends are crazy.  My one friend, Brianna...
Michael: Yeah?
Kelly: Oh, my God...
Michael: That's hilarious.  What's her number?
Kelly: She's 23.
Michael: Mmm... nah, that's too young.
Kelly: Actually, I know a ton of people that I can set you up with!
Michael: Oh.
Kelly: Some of my friends' parents, they're getting divorced now.   So I think some of those, like, older ladies, they're really looking for a guy to go on a date with.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1450]

Michael:  All right, time's up!  Pencils down.  Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1451]

Michael: Pammy?
Pam: I don't have anybody.
Michael: You don't have one single girlfriend?
Pam: No...
Michael: I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman.
Pam: Sorry.
Michael: A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
Pam: No, I don't, I...
Michael: How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
Pam: I just...
Michael: You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models  - yes.
Jim: I actually know a sex model.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?
Michael: No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Are you talking about Beverley?
Jim: Yes.
Pam: Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.
Jim: Oh, yeah.
Michael: Send me a picture.


[Date: April 17, 2008, Session #1452]

Michael: So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start.

[Date: April 24, 2008, Session #1453]

Pam: What's wrong Michael?
Michael: I got gum in my hair.
Pam: You do.
Michael: This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
Dwight: You've got a ton of dandruff.
Michael: OK, let me be.
Jim: How'd you get gum in your hair?
Michael: I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
Jim: But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
Michael: Kill me... right now.
Pam: We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
Michael: I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Jim: Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
Pam: No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.


[Date: April 24, 2008, Session #1454]

Michael: Smells good.
Dwight: Taste good too.
Michael: Oh don't. That's disgusting.
Dwight: Wow! Lot of calories.
Michael: Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1455]

Dwight: Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
Michael: 


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1456]

Michael: I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1457]

Michael: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
Ryan: Ok thanks Michael.
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Dwight: Question.
Ryan: Dwight.
Dwight: Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Ryan: This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Stanley: I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
Ryan: I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Stanley: When will that be?
Ryan: TBD. Phyllis?
Phyllis: Did the police solve the problem with the...
Ryan: Yes, yes they did, yes they did.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1458]

Dwight: I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
Jim: Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
Ryan: It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Jim: And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?'
Creed: I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
Kelly: If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
Ryan: Do you have a question Kelly?
Kelly: Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
Michael:  Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1459]

Michael: Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Ryan: You too.
Michael: Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. 
Ryan: Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Michael: Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
Ryan: Na.
Michael: Na?
Ryan: Sorry man.
Michael: Well you tried.
Ryan: But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: Unreal.
Michael: They sound great.
Ryan: Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1460]

Michael: Would you have sex with Meredith?
Jim: What?
Michael: Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
Jim: I'm gonna go to my desk.
Michael: Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
Jim: I know.
Michael: Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
Jim: I can't.
Michael: Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
Jim: I'm not single.
Michael: Who you dating?
Jim: Pam.
Michael: That's still going on?


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1461]

Michael: Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
Dwight: Yeah!
Andy: Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
Angela: I'm right here.
Dwight: No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Michael: Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
Angela: We get it.
Michael: I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
Dwight:  With sex!
Michael: That's... I, I think that...


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1462]

Michael: Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1463]

Michael: Place is packed.
Dwight: Fire hazard.
Michael: Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
Dwight: Women look like white slaves.
Michael: No, they're just hotties.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1464]

Ryan: I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
Michael: Hey.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: Hey!
Ryan: What are you doing here?
Michael: Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
Ryan: That is so awesome man!
Michael: Alright!
Ryan: And you brought this guy!
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: Aww!
Michael: Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
Ryan: I know it's you guys.
Michael: Ok.

Ryan: Woooo!
Michael: Alright!
Ryan: Let's get a drink.
Michael: Let's do it!

Ryan: Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
Michael: Hey, nice to meet you.
Troy: Hey, how ya doing?
Dwight: Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Ryan: Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Dwight: No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Ryan: Bottle service ya'll?
Michael: Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
Waitress: We don't serve food here.
Michael: Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Dwight: Do you live in a regular sized house?
Ryan: Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1466]

Michael: I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting 'Back to the Future.'  'Back' because it's on my back and 'Future' because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.
Girl in Club: I've never heard of that movie.
Michael: Back to the Future?  Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
Girl in Club: How old are you?
Michael: Forty... I'm in my forties.
Girl in Club: Wow. That's so cool.
Michael: Nuhh...
Girl in Club: Well I'm gonna go back to my group now.
Michael: Oh, OK.
Girl in Club: Thanks for the drink.
Michael: You are welcome.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1467]

Ryan: Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. 
Michael: Ahh, wow. That's dangerous.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1468]

Tall Girl #1: Uh, we're the Jersey State Varsity Basketball team. Northeast Regional Champs.
All Girls: Wooo!
Dwight: Amazons.
Ryan:  It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Michael: You're kidding.
Ryan: Let's bail. 
Dwight: Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.  You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Tall Girl #2: We're not going unless we can all go.
Dwight: OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him . Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1469]

Michael: I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
Girl in 2nd club: That's one aspect of small pet grooming. What do you do?
Michael: I am a bank teller.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1470]

Michael: Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1471]

Girl in 2nd club: Cool.

Michael: She washes dogs.
Ryan: You're doing it man.
Michael: I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
Ryan: Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Michael: Yeah, maybe. 
Ryan: It's inevitable, right?
Michael: Hmm...


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1473]

Michael:  I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not...  Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1474]

Michael:  Those girls really wailed on you bad.
Ryan: Why wouldn't they let me dance?
Michael: Well...
Troy: OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital. 
Michael: Pretty weird. 
Tall Girl #1:  You have to go with me.
Dwight: I do, I have to go.
Tall Girl #1: Stay. Stay, please?
Dwight: No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Tall Girl #1: Call me.
Dwight: Uh huh.  I'm not gonna call her.
Michael: Let's go.
Ryan: I don't wanna go back in.
Michael: I know, here we go.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1475]

Ryan: This is a one time thing, you know that right? 
Dwight: Wow.

Dwight: All right.
Michael: This is where the magic happens.
Dwight: Nice.
Michael: Very nice.
Ryan: One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Dwight: I got sofa. I got sofa.
Michael: Dwight, I'm the boss.
Dwight: I got floor.
Michael: Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
Dwight:  Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Ryan: No. 
Michael: Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
Dwight: It's a lullaby.
Michael: Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
Ryan: No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Dwight: I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Michael: Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.
Ryan: Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
Dwight: OK. Good night Ryan.
Michael: Best night ever.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1476]

Michael: Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1477]

Michael: You're gonna be okay, it's gonna...
Dwight: Ohhh, man!   There it goes.
Michael: Ahh, ooh!

Michael:  Come on, come on.
Dwight: That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Ryan: Dehydration.
Michael: Here we go, let's sit down.
Dwight: It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Michael: All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1478]

Michael: You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know...
Dwight: Friends with a hobbit.
Michael: Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.  I mean, you've got it all.
Ryan: Yeah, New York is great.
Michael: No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic.
Ryan: Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Michael: Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.


[Date: April 25, 2008, Session #1479]

Michael: Ryan?
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: Do you ever miss us?
Ryan: Not really.  New York is...so great.
Michael: Ryan?
Ryan: Yes.
Michael: Do you remember what color my eyes are?
Dwight: Hazel.  They're hazel.
Michael: Dwight, I asked him.
Ryan: No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
Michael: Really?
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: Not just because he said it?
Ryan: No.
Michael: Ryan?
Ryan: You're my friend, Michael.  OK?

[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1480]

Michael: Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
Pam: Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
Michael: Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
Kevin: Michael you could put your initials in it.
Michael: M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Jim: Yeah that's true.
Michael: Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Phyllis: We-- we--
Michael: Here we go!
Phyllis: Well--
Michael: Let's, yes?
Phyllis: When I was a little girl...
Michael: Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
Phyllis: We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Michael: It's drying, it's drying...
Phyllis: In our neighborhood...
Michael: Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
Phyllis: What did we write?
Michael: Ahh come on!
Andy: Here it is, you should draw a picture...
Michael: No!
Andy: Cause that says, that says...
Michael: No!
Andy: So much more than words...
Michael: No!! Come on, gimme something good!
Kelly: Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
Michael: Pam, translate.
Pam: She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Michael: I love it!
Jim: If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Michael: I love it more!
Oscar: Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
Michael: I... love it!! Haha, come on!
Dwight: Come on! 


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1481]

Jim: We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
Michael:  Hurry, please.
Jim: Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
Dwight: Can you breathe?
Jim: Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Dwight: Hold your breath.
Jim: And in this case...
Dwight: Ready?
Jim: That's also not true.
Dwight: And... go.  Force it in as deep as you can.
Michael:  That's what she said.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1482]

Michael: Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1483]

Michael: All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...
Pam: I don't have my contacts...
Michael: Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1484]

Michael: Ener-gize...
Jim: You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
Pam: Don't, don't--
Jim: Would...
Pam: If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
Jim: Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
Michael: Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Andy: What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
Michael: Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Jim: What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Michael: Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Jim: An urban thing...
Michael: An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Stanley: Not me.
Michael: Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
Stanley: No.
Michael: Stanley, we're havin a little...
Stanley: Leave me alone, dammit.
Michael: We're havin a little brainstorm session...
Stanley: DID I STUTTER?
Michael: ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1485]

Toby: Can I talk to you a second?
Michael: Ugh, what?
Toby: Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
Michael: What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
Toby: Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
Michael: That? In the conference room?
Toby: Yeah.
Michael: We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?
Toby: He didn't seem like he was joking.
Michael: Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
Toby: Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
Michael: Mmhmm.
Toby: Um, why don't you go ask him that?
Michael: Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Toby: You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
Michael: Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1486]

Stanley: What.
Michael: I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
Stanley: What are you talking about?
Michael: Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
Stanley: I am not going to apologize to you.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1487]

Dwight: Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Michael: Uh huh...
Dwight: There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Michael: Great
Dwight: However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Michael: What's the pink?
Dwight: Menstrual cycles.
Michael: Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
Dwight: You.
Michael: Other than me.
Dwight: Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Michael: I never said you could do that.
Dwight: All you have to do it say it.
Michael: I...
Dwight: Just say it.
Michael: Okay, I will think about it.
Dwight: Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
Michael: No.
Dwight: So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1488]

Darryl: Mike.
Michael: Hey.
Darryl: I'm very busy here, man.
Michael: Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
Darryl: Why?
Michael: It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
Darryl: No, no, no...
Michael: I know, it's very, very personal...
Darryl: No, um... I have.
Michael: I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
Darryl: Both.
Michael: God.
Darryl: Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
Michael: Okay.
Darryl: Newsies.
Michael: Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
Darryl: Oh my goodness.
Michael: Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Darryl: Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
Michael: What is that?
Darryl: That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
Michael: Really?
Darryl: Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
Michael: I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Darryl: Well, it's effective.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1489]

Michael: Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Pam: What does that mean?
Michael: It's like a mock execution.
Jim: That's not a good idea.
Michael: Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
Toby: Well, you can actually fire him.
Michael: No, okay... I've had enough of you.
Oscar: Why are you telling us this?
Michael: Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
Kevin: Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
Michael: I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1490]

Michael: Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
Stanley: Are you serious?
Michael: I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
Stanley: You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
Michael: Hmm.
Stanley: I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
Michael: Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
Stanley: So I'm not fired.
Michael: That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Stanley: Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
Michael: Okay...
Stanley: Do you have any idea how to run an office?
Michael: Yes.
Stanley: Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
Michael: That's not-
Stanley: And I think, 'there's no possible way--
Michael: All right, all right...
Stanley: He can top that.'
Michael: Okay.
Stanley: But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
Michael: Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
Jim: Who?
Michael: Everybody, except Stanley.
Jim: Let's go.
Pam: I can't find my glasses.
Jim: Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
Pam: Okay, okay.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1491]

Michael:  I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
Stanley: Oh, for the love of God.
Michael: You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
Stanley: Fine. Here it is: you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
Michael: Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
Stanley: Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
Michael: All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
Stanley: Fair enough.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1492]

Michael: I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example.  If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck.  Respect is niiice. Borat.  What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1493]

Michael: So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
Stanley: Has potential to be your best idea yet. 
Phyllis: That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. 
Michael: Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1494]

Michael: You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just...
Jim: Who else is he mean to?
Michael: Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.
Pam: What kind of stuff does Stanley say?
Michael: Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.
Kelly: Why would he say that?
Michael: Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Michael: And that Angela's a midget, and that  your chin is too big.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.
Jim: She's never worn these glasses before.
Michael: Well, he's just mean.
Pam: Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.
Michael: It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.
Jim: Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.
Kelly: Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1495]

Michael: I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand.


[Date: May 1, 2008, Session #1496]

Michael: Pam, stand up.
Pam: Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.
Meredith: Hi, Pam.
Michael: Pretty disgusting.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1497]

Michael: Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
Oscar: Yes. 
Michael: Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1498]

Michael: Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1499]

Darryl: Hey, are we doing this thing?
Michael: Yup.
Kelly: Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
Michael: Why are you dressed like that?
Darryl:  Like what?
Michael: Like you're applying for a loan.
Dwight: Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
Darryl: Figured I look presentable.  You?  Went a different way.
Pam:  I think you look nice.
Michael and Darryl:  Thank you.
Michael: Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
Darryl: What college did you go to Mike?
Michael: Let's go!


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1500]

Michael:  A little over the top, don't you think?
Darryl: Show them what you brought, Mike.
Pam:  Um, that's all we brought.
Michael: This is all we need.
Oscar: We'll see.
Michael: Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!   Hello!


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1501]

Pam: There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
Justin: Cool.
Pam:  Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
Michael: Hello. Hi.  Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Pam: This is Michael, my boss.  Justin.
Michael: Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, 'only the best and the brightest.'
Pam: He's nice and he seems interested.
Michael: He's totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.
Justin: Hi.
Michael: How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
Justin: Sorry for wasting your time.
Michael: Oh, no problem.  And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
Darryl: Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
Pam: I only brought the one.
Michael: Are you mental?
Pam: Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?
Michael: I... don't.
Pam: Okay. I'll go look for another one. 
Michael: And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1502]

Michael:  Hello there.
Kid: What is this company?
Michael: Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
Oscar: Dunder Mifflin paper.
Kid: Thanks. 
Michael: Dammit, Oscar!


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1503]

Michael: Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days. Thank you Dateline!


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1504]

Michael:  What do you want?
Dwight: Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Michael: Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
Dwight: So... what else is up?  Mich-


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1505]

Michael: Thank you!  What, what is this?
Pam: A piece of paper.
Michael: This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
Pam: Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
Michael: Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
Pam: Are you serious?
Michael: Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
Pam: Okay.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1506]

Michael: All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1507]

Michael: Hey!  Game over. 


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1508]

Michael:  Just-in time.
Justin: Hi.
Michael: Just-in case. What's your last name?
Justin: Polznik.
Michael: This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1509]

Michael: Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1510]

Michael: I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
Oscar: Hey.
Justin: Hi.
Michael: This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
Pam: Excuse me.
Michael: Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
Oscar: Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
Michael: So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Justin: You didn't want me before. That's what you said.
Michael: No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
Justin: You were kind of a jerk to me.
Michael: I, uh, hmm.
Justin: And I'm, I'm gonna go now.
Michael: Why don't... hey.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1511]

Woman on mic: The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
Michael: Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1512]

Michael: Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1513]

Michael:  Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. 


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1514]

Michael: Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they're being distracted by the other booths.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1515]

Michael:  Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.
Brad: Brad Bailey, nice to meet you.
Michael: That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.
Brad: Yeah.
Michael: So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...
Brad: Sales, uh, sales would be cool.
Michael: Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
Brad: Well, that's great.
Michael: Right here.  We have a lot of fun.
Brad: Mmhmm.
Michael:  This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly,  receptionist extraordinaire.
Brad: Hey, Pam, what's up?
Michael: Check that out, huh?
Pam: Hi, nice to meet you.
Michael: Pretty nice.
Brad: Yeah.
Michael: She sits there all day.
Brad: Nice.
Michael: You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand.  Tell me what you feel.
Brad: Paper.
Michael: That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?'  And I think we both know the answer.  We'll find that out together.  You can keep that.
Brad: Are you sure?
Michael: Mmm, yeah.
Brad: Sweet. 
Michael: Don't fold it, though.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1516]

Michael: We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.    I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?    So, sexy is fun...
Brad: Well, it was nice meeting you, I'm, I'm gonna take off.
Michael: Hey, you know what?  Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?
Brad: Oh, yeah.
Michael: Yeah, me, too.
Brad: Okay, well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Michael: Okay, be my guest.
Brad: Thanks.
Michael: And do your worst.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1517]

Michael:  Hey.
Brad: Whoa, come on!
Michael: So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this...
Brad: Yeah, I get it, okay, I'm not interested.  Stop following me around; you're really starting to creep me out.
Michael: One other thing I wanted to...
Brad: Nnn, look.  I was just being polite.  I don't want to waste my life selling paper for your stupid company, okay? 
Michael:   Ohh...Nah.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1518]

Michael: Hey, Justin!
Justin: I'm sorry, I'm sort of in the middle of this.
Michael: Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?
Air Force recruiter: Absolutely.  Justin is smart, capable, ambitious, and he aims high.
Michael: Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
Air Force recruiter: I think Justin can be anything he wants to be.
Justin:  Okay.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: May 8, 2008, Session #1519]

Michael: Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?
Justin: Well, you took away the brochure, so I sort of...
Michael: Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here  and it's in here. 
Justin: Oh.
Michael: I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
Justin: That's what the recruiter just said.
Michael: I'm right.

[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1520]

Michael: Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1521]

Toby: Morning.
Michael: Mornin'.  So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... 


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1522]

Michael: First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
Angela: We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
Michael: Okay.
Angela: But so far we only have two pictures of him.
Michael: Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
Pam: Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
Michael: If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
Angela: Michael...
Michael: Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
Angela: No. You know-no!
Michael: Toga!
Angela: You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
Michael: I thought that you might say that. 


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1523]

Michael: Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. 'Michael, buy a motorcycle.' So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1524]

Michael: I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
Pam: So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Angela: No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
Michael: Phyllis, can you do this?
Phyllis:  Yes.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1525]

Toby: Hey, Stanley...
Stanley: Hmm?
Toby: I want to introduce you to...
Michael:  Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
Dwight: So what do we know about her?
Michael: Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Dwight: I hate her too.
Michael: Why do you hate her?
Dwight: Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Michael: You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
Dwight: Would that be such a bad thing?
Michael: Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
Dwight: What?
Michael: We need to sell her an elevator pass.
Dwight: But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... 
Michael: Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1526]

Michael:  Yeah.
Toby: Hey Michael.
Michael: Oh, hey, do you still work here?
Toby: I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
Michael: Nah.
Toby: Come on.
Michael: No. I think I will pass.
Toby: Michael Scott, this is Holly.
Holly: Hi.
Michael: Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.
Holly: Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
Michael: Yeah.
Holly:  What did you do to him?
Toby: Nothing.
Michael: T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
Holly: Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
Michael: Y-You can-Michael.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1527]

Michael: Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1528]

Dwight: Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. 
Holly: Hello. Hello.  Hi.
Kevin: Hi.
Holly: What do you do?
Kevin: I do the numbers.
Holly: Oh, good for you.
Kevin: Do you want a M&M?
Holly: Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
Kevin: Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Holly: Well that is a very safe place for them.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
Holly: Oh...  Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
Michael: I bet.
Holly: That's good.
Michael: I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Holly: No, no, I...
Michael: Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
Holly: Ooh, uh...
Michael: You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Holly: Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
Michael: All right.
Holly: Thanks.
Michael: Yep.
Holly: Great.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1529]

Michael:  Hmm... Jim?  I am downloading some N3P...
Jim: That's not it.
Michael: Music...
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: For a CD mix tape...
Jim: Close.
Michael: For Holly.
Jim: Mmhmm.
Michael: And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
Jim: What are the two levels?
Michael: The two levels being, uh, 'Welcome to Scranton'...
Jim: Mmhmm.
Michael: And 'I... love you.'
Jim: Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.
Michael: Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
Jim: Yes. You don't love Holly.
Michael: I think I do.
Jim: But you just met her.
Michael: Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
Jim: Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
Michael: Well, you're not a romantic.
Jim: Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Michael: Oh really?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Like, with who?
Jim: We've been through this.
Michael: Pam?
Jim: Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
Michael: Yeah, you took it too slow.
Jim: Well, we're really happy.
Michael: This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
Jim: And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Michael: I don't want her to get away.
Jim: I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1530]

Holly:  Damn it!
Michael: Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
Holly: Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
Michael: And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
Holly: Yoga.
Michael:  Sit on floor and put together chair we will.  Yo-da. Um...
Holly:  Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
Michael: So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
Holly: Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
Michael: Kidding.  Acting!
Holly:  Acting!
Michael:  Acting!
Holly:  Lovitz.
Michael: Yeah.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1531]

Michael: I did it! 
Jim: What'd you do?
Michael: I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
Jim: Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
Michael: It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
Jim: Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Michael: Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base...
Jim: There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Michael:  Yeah...


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1532]

Toby:  What'd you guys do?
Michael: Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
Toby: Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
Michael: Yes we do.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1533]

Michael: I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1534]

Toby:  Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
Michael: Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
Holly:  Hello.
Michael: Hey! Hi, good to see you.
Holly: You too.
Michael: I'm just having a little exit interview.
Holly: Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
Michael: Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
Holly: No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
Michael: Okay.
Pam:  Did you need me to take notes?
Toby: Hi Pam. Stay.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
Toby: I'm Toby.
Michael: Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
Holly: Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
Michael: Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Holly: Here you go.
Michael: Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
Toby: This place, um...
Michael: Well, no no no no no...
Toby: I've got some ideas, I guess...
Michael: No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
Holly: Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
Toby: Well let me see... I would, uh...
Michael:  I'll kill you.
Toby: I guess everything's okay.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1535]

Pam: Toby, why don't you open your present?
Michael: Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
Toby:  'Suck on this.'
Michael: What the hell is that?
Pam: Michael...
Michael: That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
Dwight: You did.
Michael: No!
Dwight: You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- 
Michael: Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
Pam: So what is your gift?
Michael: My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
Pam: What is it?
Michael: I am going to give Toby...
Pam: Your watch?
Michael: ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
Pam: I just knew.
Michael: How did you know?
Holly: Oh that is so sweet.
Michael: Well... That's my watch.
Toby: Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
Michael: Hey, that's good.
Creed:  Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look!  Hey! It's the temp! Look! 
Dwight: Oh my gosh.
Creed: It's the temp! 
Pam: Is that the police?
Dwight: Yes.
Creed: Mm-hmm.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1536]

Michael:  Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1537]

Holly: What's protocol on this?
Toby: I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- 
Holly: Michael, are you okay?
Michael:  I'm just worried about my friend.
Holly: Oh, of course you are.
Michael: Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
Holly: No, hey.
Michael: I'm cool.
Holly: Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1538]

Michael: Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1539]

Kevin:  Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Phyllis: Kevin, take your shoes off first!
Michael: No antigravity machine, huh?
Phyllis: Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
Michael: Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1540]

Holly: Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
Michael: That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Holly: I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
Michael: Thanks.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1541]

Dwight: You have it?
Meredith: Almost. 
Dwight: Okay, here we go. Here we go.  Put it in. 
Michael: I like, uh...
Holly: That-That's my car.
Michael: Hey. What are you doing?
Dwight:  Mose!
Michael: What the hell is going on here?!
Dwight: N-nothing you need to know the details of.
Michael: There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
Dwight: N-no there's not.
Michael: Why did you do that?
Dwight: It was playful hazing.
Michael: No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?
Dwight: It's not rabid.
Michael: Shh...
Meredith: Thanks for bringing that up.
Dwight: Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1542]

Michael: I'm really sorry.
Holly: Michael, thank you so much for saying that.  I feel so welcome here.
Michael: Yeah...
Holly: I just... Um, excuse me.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1543]

Michael: Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! 


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1544]

Michael:  Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band.  You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
Pam:  Yay, Phyllis!
Michael: Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
Pam: Song parody writer.
Michael: I have done things like um, 'Beers in Heaven.'
Jim: Classic.
Michael: Or, 'Total Eclipse of the Fart.'
Jim: Not my favorite, but...
Pam: I like that one.
Jim: It's not my favorite...
Pam: I like that one.
Michael: I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, 'Goodbye Stranger'? Supertramp?
Darryl: Yeah. 
Michael:  It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1545]

Michael:  Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1546]

Michael:  Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1547]

Holly: Not bad.
Michael: Oh, hey. Thanks.
Holly: Someday I would love to hear 'Beers in Heaven.'
Michael: Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual.  Sorry. Kevin.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
Michael: Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
Kevin: No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
Michael: What is it?
Kevin: Just hurry. 
Holly: Is he okay?
Michael: Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
Holly: Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
Michael: Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1548]

Jan: Well it was good to see you.
Kevin: It was great to see you, Jan.
Jan: Yeah, so...
Michael: O-kay. Hello Jan.
Jan: Hello... Michael.
Michael: Wow, Kevin, really? We're-  Sorry. We're in the middle of a party.  Is this why you called me down here?
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
Jan: I...
Kevin: I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Thanks, Kevin. Um... 


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1549]

Michael: Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you!  Are you nauseous?
Jan: No.
Michael: Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
Jan: Uh, no.
Michael: Good. Good. Thank God.
Jan: I didn't...
Michael: Cause that's...
Jan: ... touch that.
Michael: Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
Jan: Why?
Michael: Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
Jan: Yeah, it did...
Michael: ... proud.
Jan: ... happen when...
Michael: Um...
Jan: ... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
Michael: You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
Jan: ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you.  I did not.
Michael: Well, okay...
Jan: Yeah.
Michael: So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
Jan: I went to a sperm bank.
Michael: You did?
Jan: Yuh-huh.
Michael: When we were going out?
Jan: Uh, yeah.
Michael: W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
Jan: I know.
Michael: You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
Jan: No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
Michael: IHop.
Jan: IHop.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1550]

Jan: Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
Michael: I'm glad you told me.
Jan: Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
Michael: Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
Jan: Okay.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1551]

Michael: My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1552]

Holly: Hey there.
Michael: Hey.
Holly: So you missed something really big.
Michael: Yeah?
Holly: Yeah, Andy proposed to one of your accountants.
Michael: Oh, wow.
Holly: I'm not so specific as I can be on my first day, but...
Michael: Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh...
Holly: So... You know, somehow after all those ribs, I'm still really hungry. I don't know, I was thinking of maybe going off-campus somewhere, getting some dessert, or...
Michael: Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Holly: Okay.
Kevin: I'll go to the diner with you.
Holly: Oh that would be great.
Kevin: Yeah, we can go eat pie.
Holly: I love pie.
Kevin: Me too.
Holly: Okay.
Michael: Have a good night.
Holly: Okay. Good night.
Michael: Bye.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1553]

Michael: Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Toby: Thanks...  Really, Michael?
Michael: Sorry. Corporate policy.
Toby: It's not.
Michael: You might take something.
Hank: I don't think he's gonna take anything.
Michael: Okay, security guard.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1554]

Toby:  Oh, some kind of... alarm.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1555]

Michael:  Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning.  I am going to be... kind of a daddy.


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1556]

Dwight: Looks serious.
Someone: What's a...
Michael: Oh, my God.
Dwight: Troy, do you know anything about this?
Troy: Maybe I do.
Dwight: Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!


[Date: May 15, 2008, Session #1557]

Michael: Toby Flenderson, come on up here.
Toby: Uh, no, that's okay.
Michael: Come on, no, no, no.
Co-workers: Toby! Come on, Toby!
Michael: Toby!
Co-workers: Toby! Toby! Toby!
Toby: Okay, okay, I'm going.
Michael: Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.  It's very funny and charming and heartwarming.  And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.   No!  So, take it away, Toby!  Whoo!
Toby: Well, uh, okay. Um.  It's really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I'm gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I'm gonna have to take a leak-a.   Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where...
Michael: Ach,  okay, okay, play the cutoff music.
Darryl: No.
Toby: I'm gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night  and lastly, I'd love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it's a, it's a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh...
Michael: Blah, blah, blah, blah...
Toby: ...building looked into...
Michael: ...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let's keep it moving!  Let's keep it moving!  Toby, everybody!


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1558]

Michael: Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy.  This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to.  She probably won't be up for a few hours.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1559]

Michael: This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. 


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1560]

Michael: Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Jim: What?
Dwight: Where?
Michael: It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
Stanley: What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
Oscar: So she's really going to be fine?
Michael: Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
Pam: Thank God you were there.
Michael: Yeah.
Andy: Did you see who did it?
Dwight: No need we can just check the security tapes.
Michael: Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
Jim: Who was driving?
Pam: Oh, Michael.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1561]

Dwight: It's only Meredith.
Michael: Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
Dwight: Hey... Why did you do it?
Michael: It was an accident.
Dwight: Was she talkin' back?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1562]

Michael: My lord my liege.
Ryan: Yes Michael?


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1563]

Michael: So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1564]

Michael: So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
Ryan: Back? Why is that Michael?
Michael: Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
Ryan: Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
Michael: No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
Ryan: Did this happen on company property?
Michael: Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
Ryan: I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Michael: Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?
Ryan: 


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1565]

Michael: Ok, I have an announcement.
Oscar: You pushed Darryl out the window?
Michael: No.
Phyllis: You shot Dwight?
Michael: No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
Jim: Oh good, so we don't have to work.
Pam: OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
Michael: So, like a freedom tree.
Pam: I can take 3 people.
Jim: I can also take 3 people.
Oscar:  Separate cars.
Michael: Pam.
Pam: Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
Michael: Pam.
Pam: Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
Michael: Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
Pam: I...
Michael: Excellent!
Pam: I was thinking that we...
Michael: Good work Pam.
Pam: But...
Michael: Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
Stanley: You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
Michael: Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1566]

Michael: Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1567]

Michael: Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
Kelly: She looks awful.
Michael: No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
Jim: I think she's awake.
Michael: No... She's in a coma.
Nurse: No.
Michael: OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
Meredith: At the same time.
Michael: Yeah.
Stanley: Hello Meredith.
Meredith: This is weird.
Michael: Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
Kevin: Whoa!
Michael: Nurse.
Meredith: No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Michael:  I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
Jim: I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
Nurse: What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
Meredith: Thanks.
Kevin: 
Phyllis: Does it hurt terribly?
Meredith: No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Creed: Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
Meredith: I have no idea.
Creed: Oh. 
Meredith: Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Michael: Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
Meredith: Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
Michael: Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
Angela: No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
Michael: Well, just shhhh... just just...
Meredith: You cracked my pelvis
Michael: Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
Meredith: You're not forgiven.
Michael: Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Pam: Michael! Michael!
Meredith: 


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1568]

Michael: Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1569]

Pam:  It's gonna be OK.
Michael: OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
Pam: Michael, Angela's cat died.
Michael: Sprinkles?
Angela: 
Michael:  Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1570]

Michael: Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1571]

Michael: Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
Oscar: Like what?
Michael: Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
Toby: No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
Pam: That's cool.
Toby: Yeah.
Michael: Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Angela: Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
Dwight: She's only a cat.
Angela: You never... you don't like them.
Dwight: Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Oscar: Dwight please!
Michael: Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
Dwight: No, I have not.
Michael: Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
Dwight: I do not respect her, but I will go.
Michael: Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Toby: Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
Michael: Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
Toby: Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
Michael: Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
Stanley: I'm... um, Catholic.
Michael: OK.
Darryl: Presbyterian.
Michael: Alright.
Pam: Oh me too.
Darryl: Oh?
Pam:  Same religion.
Darryl: Alright! 
Phyllis: I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Angela: That's why we're cursed.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1572]

Michael: Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
Kelly: That's Buddhist.
Michael: Are you sure?
Kelly: No.
Michael: What are you?
IT Tech Guy: Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.
Michael: OK, 1 Sikh, and...


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1573]

Michael: You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.  And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
Kelly: If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
Michael: Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
Jim: I will do some research.
Pam: I can help you with that.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1574]

Dwight: So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
Michael: Oh God, Rabies?
Dwight: Mm-hmm.
Michael: I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Dwight: No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
Michael: This place is so cursed.
Dwight: Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Michael:  I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
Jim: Six of one, really.
Michael: Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1575]

Michael: Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?


[Date: September 27, 2007, Session #1576]

Pam: Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
Michael: Pro-Am.
Pam: Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1577]

Michael: A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1578]

Stanley:  No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
Michael: Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
Stanley: Zero.
Michael: Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
Andy: Isn't that your money?
Michael: That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
Phyllis: Oh, it's coming.
Michael: Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
Kevin: Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Kevin: You cannot make me run.
Michael: OK. 
Kevin: It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
Michael: Alright, alright.
Kevin: You didn't run for me...
Michael: Shhh...
Kevin: ...when I thought I had skin cancer.
Michael: I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
Kevin: No.
Michael: OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
Kevin: I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Michael: Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1579]

Michael: We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
Pam: Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
Michael: Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
Jim: Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
Pam: Giant check it is.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Yep.
Dwight: Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Jim: Bat birth control
Dwight: Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Michael: You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Pam: Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
Jim: Which we are.
Pam: And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
Michael: What about a rabies nurse?
Pam: I don't think so.
Jim: You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Michael: That's possible. Look into that.
Jim: Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
Dwight: Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Michael: Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1580]

Pam: Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. 
Michael: Come in.
Pam: Hey.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey
Pam: Oh my God.
Michael: What are you doing?
Pam: You said come in!
Michael: No I didn't, just please don't...
Pam: Oh my God.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1581]

Pam: So I closed the door but the image of his...
Jim: Baquette.
Pam: ... dangling participle...
Jim: Eww.
Pam: ... still burned in my eyes.
Jim: I can imagine.
Pam:  Come in.
Michael: May I enter the room?
Pam: Yes. Or come in.
Michael: See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
Jim: You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
Michael: Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
Pam: On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
Michael: European offices are naked all the time.
Pam: They're so not.
Michael: Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
Pam: I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
Jim:  Gross.
Michael: That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
Jim: Alright.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1582]

Michael: Check that out.  Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1583]

Jan: So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
Pam: What? Look, no it was not...
Jan: I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
Michael: OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
Darryl:  I'm giving him a peanut.
Michael: No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
Darryl: Look how happy he is.
Michael: He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse?  This is the reason we're here.
Elizabeth: Hello Michael.
Michael: Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
Elizabeth: Yeah.
Michael: Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
Elizabeth: Great. 


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1584]

Michael: You got it?
Dwight: Mm-hmm.
Michael: OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1585]

Michael: Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
Dwight: On your marks, get set...
Michael:  Beow!
Toby: Hey! 


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1586]

Michael: On your left!
Oscar: You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Creed: That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
Michael: I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. 


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1587]

Jan: Water? Water?  Water babe?
Michael: No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
Jan: Michael that's irrational.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1588]

Michael: Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1589]

Michael: That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
Dwight: You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Michael:  Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1590]

Michael:  Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. 


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1591]

Dwight: How ya feeling, better?
Angela: No.
Dwight: Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Angela: The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
Dwight: I am a farmer Angela.
Angela: What does that mean?
Dwight: OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Angela: You did kill her!?
Dwight: I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
Angela: You put her in my freezer.
Dwight: It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Angela: Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
Dwight: Well I'm not responsible for that!
Angela: You! 
Dwight: Hey, Oww!  It's OK.
Angela: It's OK.
Dwight: It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
Angela: It's nothing.
Dwight: It's fine. What?
Angela: How could you do that without telling me?
Dwight: I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Angela: Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
Dwight: I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
Angela: You don't understand.
Michael:  Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
Dwight: Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Angela: Don't touch me Dwight! 


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1592]

Michael:  I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. 


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1593]

Jim: ...talk about it.
Pam: Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
Jim: What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
Michael: I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
Jim: Well, you're probably dehydrated.
Michael: What do you want me to do Jim?
Jim: Glass of water would be a start.
Michael: No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
Jim: Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Pam: I'm still having a nice day.
Jim: You are?
Pam: Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
Michael: That's a good deal.
Pam: And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
Michael: Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Pam: Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
Michael: You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
Pam: I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
Michael: You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no!


[Date: September 28, 2007, Session #1594]

Michael: Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1595]

Meredith: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey Mer. How ya doing?
Meredith: Better.
Michael: It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
Meredith: I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Michael: Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?
Meredith: Sure.
Michael: I'm not really sick.  Nah, I'm good.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1596]

Michael: Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
Andy: Ay-o!
Jim: I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
Michael: Well...
Phyllis: That's despicable.
Pam: Michael.
Someone: That's not cool.
Oscar: There's no proof of that.
Michael: That's not...
Kevin: That seems early, even for her.
Michael: That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1597]

Andy: Then... what are you saying?
Michael: I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
Jim: Definitely not.
Kevin: That'd be DUI.
Phyllis: That's...
Michael: Okay.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1598]

Michael: Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1599]

Angela: They don't have this kind of technology at the vet's.  It's not far.
Oscar: It's fair.
Michael: You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
Kevin: I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Andy: So, how's the view old girl?    Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...
Michael: Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.
Angela: Bye, Meredith.  Here you go.  We got you some balloons.
Meredith: See you guys. 
Michael: Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
Meredith: Oh please, Michael.
Michael: I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.
Meredith: You're gonna be here a
Michael:  Oh, okay.
Meredith: Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
Nurse: There you go.
Meredith: There's nothing in here.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1600]

Michael: This office is cursed.    And we need to do something about it.
Jim: Conference room?
Michael: Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here  is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1601]

Michael: On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1602]

Dwight: Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
Michael: We have to have done something wrong.
Stanley: You ran over an employee.
Michael: That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
Dwight: Mmm.  
Michael: Oscar, are you Santaria?
Oscar: I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
Michael: Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
Oscar: Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
Michael: Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
Oscar: Oh.
Michael: Stupid.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1603]

Michael: Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone  but I won't do it.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1604]

Michael: Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh!
Bob Vance: Let... let's pick it up, Phyllis!
Michael: Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho.   You guys are going so slow...
Phyllis: Go get him Bobby!
Michael: Come on, I'm going backwards.
Phyllis: Sic him!
Michael: Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!
Phyllis: Sic him!
Michael: Okay! 


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1605]

Pediatrician: You're gonna be just fine, Michael!  You're gonna have a good life.
Michael: Thanks.
Pediatrician: Lots of people suffer dehydration; they all recover just fine.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1606]

Michael: Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.


[Date: September 29, 2007, Session #1607]

Michael: Hey, doc?  You forgetting something?   Thank you.

[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1608]

Michael: Hey Toby. What's this? 
Toby: Ohh.
Michael:  I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Toby: Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
Michael: Oh really.
Toby: ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know  I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
Michael: Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
Toby: Ok, look the memo is not about you...
Angela:  For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
Toby: Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
Michael:  No way.
Dwight: What?
Phyllis: You guys are together?
Jim: Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Michael: Woooah! Wow!
Andy: Tuna!
Michael: Awesome!
Kevin: I knew it!
Michael: You guys! Yes! Yes!
Pam: Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
Toby: Yes.
Michael: Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Jim: Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Michael: I love you guys, so much. 
Jim: Ohh.. 
Pam: Phone's ringing. 
Michael: No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1609]

Michael: Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
Phyllis: Did you plan it?
Michael: No. 
Pam:  Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
Michael: Blowing up balloons I thought.
Pam: You might want to trim it a little.
Phyllis: Michael... 
Kelly:  Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
Pam: Yeah, he is.
Kelly: Oh.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1610]

Michael: Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1611]

Pam:  Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Ryan: Hold on one second.  Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Michael: Hey!
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
Ryan: OK. Should we get started?
Michael: Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
Ryan: Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Michael: ...business meeting --
Kevin:  Fire!
Ryan: Stop that! Stop that!
Michael: That's right! That's right!
Ryan:  You scared me.
Michael: Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
Andy: Fire guy 
Kevin: You weren't here for that.
Andy: Here for what?
Kevin: When he started the fire.
Michael: Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
Kevin: Little old man boy.
Ryan: Michael and everybody, umm...
Michael: Beard.
Kevin: Bearded man boy.
Ryan: ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Michael: Oh, wow!
Ryan: So...
Michael: That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Ryan: OK...
Michael: Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Ryan: Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Michael: Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
Ryan: Perfect.
Michael: Sounds good. OK, alright.

Michael: Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1613]

Ryan: This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Michael: OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Ryan: I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Dwight: What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Ryan: This is company-wide, Dwight.
Dwight: Got it. 
Ryan: Andy.
Andy: We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
Ryan: Any other questions?  Kelly Kapoor.
Kelly: Can we speak privately about our relationship?
Ryan: Thank you everybody.
Michael: Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job. 
Creed: That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Ryan: As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
Creed: Cool beans.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1614]

Creed: We're screwed.
Michael: Who is?
Creed: Us? You and me. The old timers.
Michael: I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Creed: You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1615]

Ryan: OK, what's up?
Michael: Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Ryan: Well it is business, but not as usual.
Michael: Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
Ryan: No.  We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Michael: Good, so, we're on the same page?
Ryan: No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1616]

Michael: We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1617]

Jan: Hi, Pam.
Pam: Hi.
Jan: Is Michael in?
Pam: In his office. You can go right in.
Jan:  Hey.
Ryan: Jan.
Jan: Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
Ryan: So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Jan: Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
Ryan: Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
Jan: Different salary.  You'll get there, don't worry.
Ryan: Well... you look great.
Jan: Thank you, thank you.
Ryan: Scranton suits you.
Jan: Best decision I ever made.
Ryan: You were let go.
Jan: You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. 
Michael: Hey.
Jan: Hey.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1618]

Michael:  Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
Jan: What?
Michael: I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Jan: So, what's Ryan doing here?
Michael: Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
Jan: He's such a snake.
Michael: Well...
Jan: I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
Michael: What is that... word?
Jan: Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
Michael: So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
Jan: Yes, Michael, they do.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1619]

Ryan: Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Pam: Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
Ryan:  Ohh... man.
Michael: Good, we're all here, we can get started.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: Have a seat.
Ryan: We're not doing this today.
Michael: Have a seat. Like everybody else.
Ryan: OK. This is...
Michael: Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
Toby: Technically, he's right.
Michael: Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Creed: Because they're lame.
Michael: No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?'   Yeah.
Jim: Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Pam: Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
Michael: I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Pam: Oh. 
Robert Dunder: Michael Scott?
Michael:  That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? 
Dwight: Oh, yeah. Yes!
Robert Dunder: Thank you everyone.
Ryan: Michael,  can I talk to you a second?
Michael: Sure thing.  'Scuse me. 


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1620]

Ryan: We have actual work to do.
Michael: Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. 


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1621]

Michael: Bob, how old are you?
Robert Dunder: I'm 87.
Michael: Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
Robert Dunder: Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
Michael: Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1622]

Robert Dunder: I started this company in 1949.
Michael: Wow.
Robert Dunder: Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
Michael: Oh, boy.
Robert Dunder: And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
Michael: Great.
Robert Dunder: And he was, he was  at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
Michael: Great.
Robert Dunder: And...
Michael: That's great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Robert Dunder: Well I, I, I came here in a cab.
Michael: Perfect. 
Robert Dunder: Well, cou, could you get me another... 
Michael: Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. 
Pam: I think that I should help him get home.
Michael: No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.


[Date: October 4, 2007, Session #1623]

Michael: Good night guys. 
Ryan: Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Michael: I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Ryan: Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Michael: I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Ryan: Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas.   Where do you wanna go?
Kelly: You know, some place romantic and expensive.
Ryan: Kelly, come on.
Kelly: You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. 


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1624]

Michael: Smell that. Do you smell that?
Dwight: Dry rot?
Michael: No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Andy: Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
Michael: Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1625]

Michael: Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1626]

Michael: Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Ryan: What's, uh, going on here?
Michael: I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
Ryan: With gift baskets.
Michael: With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1627]

Michael: Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods.  We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1628]

Michael: OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
Stanley: I'm not driving with him. 
Andy: I'll go with you Stanley.
Stanley: Or him.
Jim: Why don't we just go by ourselves?
Michael: Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
Phyllis: Michael.
Michael: Yes?
Phyllis: This is stupid.
Michael: OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
Phyllis: How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Michael: Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
Andy: What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
Jim: What about a gift basket full of cash?
Andy: Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
Michael: Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. 
Dwight: Michael, wait. Let me go.
Michael: No, this is my quest.
Dwight: Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please.
Michael: Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Ryan: Good luck Michael.
Michael: We don't need luck.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
Dwight: Thank you.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1629]

Michael: Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1630]

Dwight:  Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Michael: It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
Dwight: Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
Michael: I know. So who's next?
Dwight: Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
GPS: Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
Dwight: Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Michael: Who?
Dwight: The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. 


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1631]

Michael:  Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
Larry Myers: You know we closed our account with you right?
Michael: Yes we do.
Larry Myers: We're with Office Depot now.
Dwight: Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
Michael: Well...
Dwight: And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Michael: Mmhmm.
Larry Myers: OK. I don't think we're coming back.
Dwight: Please, come back.
Michael: OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Dwight: Remember what we had Larry?
Larry Myers: I mean, really it's about money.
Michael: Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
Larry Myers: OK thanks.
Michael: Alright.
Larry Myers: I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1632]

Michael:  That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Dwight: I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Michael: That is true.
Dwight: Like Angela in accounting.
Michael: Yes, she is nuts.
Dwight: Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
GPS: Make the next right turn.
Michael: How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1633]

Michael: And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.
Ex-client: You know I have heard it before.
Michael: Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
Ex-client: She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory.
Michael: She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Ex-client: Oh, OK.
Michael: OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?
Ex-client: OK thanks for the goodies.
Michael: Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Ex-client: It looks delicious? I don't know.
Dwight: You don't know?
Michael: Look, we want you back.
Ex-client: Can you offer lower prices?
Michael: Well, no.
Ex-client: Then we're not coming back.
Dwight: He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
Michael: No it's not.
Ex-client: No he's right.
Dwight: Accept it, why would he come back?
Michael: Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
Dwight: That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Michael: Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
Ex-client: Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back.
Michael: Great, the magic of the gift basket.
Ex-client: That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.
Michael: OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1634]

GPS: Proceed straight.
Dwight:  Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Michael: I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
Dwight: That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Michael: That is a very good point, Dwight.
GPS: Make a right turn.
Dwight: Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Michael: No, it said right, it said take a right.
Dwight: No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Michael: Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. 
Dwight: It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Michael: The machine knows where it is going!
Dwight: This is the lake!
Michael: The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
Dwight: No, it's--- there's no road here! 
Dwight: Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Okay, exit the window!  Here we go! Look out for leeches!  Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you!  Michael! Michael!
Michael: Let go, let go of me!
Dwight: I got you, I got you! 


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1635]

Michael:  You sure you're OK?
Dwight: Fine.
Michael: Good, that is what's most important.
Dwight: Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1636]

Michael: What a disaster, this whole thing.
Dwight: I'll call a cab. 
Michael: These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
Dwight: Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Michael: What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Dwight:  Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Michael: Hang up.  You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
Dwight: Take a stand!


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1637]

Ex-client: Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
Michael: Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
Ex-client: Oh what is this?
Dwight: It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Ex-client: Maybe you should leave.
Michael: Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! 
Dwight: Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna  Oops, sorry!
Michael: Look, my clothes are so wet!
Dwight: Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! 
Ex-client:  Alright here you go, take it back!
Michael: It's been opened.
Ex-client: Yeah it was mine!
Michael: What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
Ex-client: Come on guys, get out of here!
Michael: WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
Dwight:  Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Ex-client: I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!
Dwight:  We'll bill you.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1638]

Michael: May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
Ryan: That is not correct.
Michael: Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Oscar: You did what?
Michael: I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
Jim: Into a lake.
Michael: Exactly!
Phyllis: Did you get any clients back?
Michael: Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1639]

Michael: Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1640]

Michael: Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1641]

Oscar:  Um... 
Michael: Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up.  All right.
Ryan:  Have a seat with everybody else.
Michael: You don't want me to help?
Ryan: You don't know what I'm going to talk about.    Actually, can you do me a favor?
Michael: Yes?
Ryan: Can you get me a cold water?
Pam: I got it.
Ryan: That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. 
Michael:  Um... yes, I'll be right back!
Ryan: Thank you.
Jim: That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
Ryan: I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1642]

Michael: I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1643]

Michael: Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him?
Kelly: Well, he's super-ticklish, I don't know if that helps.
Michael: I know, I know, no, what... something else.
Kelly: Oh, he's also super-insecure about his height.
Michael: Uh-huh.
Kelly: And he doesn't care about anybody but himself.
Michael: Good.
Kelly: And don't have sex with him, 'cause if you do, the next two years of your life will be a total waste of time.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1644]

Michael: My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever.
Oscar: You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.
Michael: And still rockin', Oscar.  One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius.  He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret.  Here's some of his quotes.  Confucius say, 'Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew.'  Confucius say, 'Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.'  Confucius also say, 'Virgin like balloon.  One prick, all gone!'
Oscar: Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
Michael: No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1645]

Jan:  Michael, please would you not email while we're having lunch?
Michael: I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1646]

Michael: BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.    Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.   Apple. 


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1647]

Michael: This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on.
Pam: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Mmhmm.
Pam: Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.
Michael: I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?
Pam: Sure.


[Date: October 5, 2007, Session #1648]

Michael:  The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.


[Date: October 11, 2007, Session #1649]

Michael: And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.


[Date: October 11, 2007, Session #1650]

Michael: We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? 
Andy: Dah!  Come on!
Michael: Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland.
Oscar: It's never gonna happen.
Kevin: Dude, you gotta believe.
Michael: Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Jim:  Wait for it.
Michael: Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a 'Where's Waldo.' 
Everyone: Oh! Yes!
Michael:  Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.
Kevin: That was so awesome.
Michael: That was awesome. Thank you.


[Date: October 11, 2007, Session #1651]

Michael: Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1652]

Pam: Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
Michael: Oh, does he?
Pam: He does.
Michael: Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
Jim: Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Michael: And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1653]

Michael: Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1654]

Michael: The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
Dwight: That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Jim: Actually it sounds like you are.
Dwight: Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?
Kelly: If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
Michael: No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight.
Stanley: Yes, please let us know.
Dwight: I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Angela: Waste of time.
Michael: What's that, pipsqueak?
Angela: Waste of time.  The website's going to win.
Dwight: You believe a computer can beat me?
Angela: I don't care, but yes.
Dwight: Well I will prove you wrong.
Angela: I don't care, and you won't.
Dwight: We'll see.
Angela: I won't be watching, and I won't.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1655]

Phyllis: So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Angela: I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
Phyllis: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Angela: It is awful.  You've made this day awful!
Kevin: Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Angela: Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Michael: Ohh, lunch party.
Angela: It's supposed to say launch!
Michael: Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Angela: I care!


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1656]

Michael: Okay.
Pam: Yes it's too tight.
Kelly: Waaay too tight.
Michael: Really?
Oscar: This is why I'm here?
Kelly: Why is it so tight?
Michael: It's the European cut.
Angela: Is just looks bad.
Michael: Umm... hey.  Ah, what's hanging?
Tech Guy: Setting up the web-cam for the party.
Michael: Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Kelly: Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
Michael: I had um, one of those danishes.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Kelly: You had carbs?  That's awful.
Pam: Uh, just one second.  We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available.  It's Jan.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1657]

Michael: Why don't you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  It'll be fun.
Jan:  My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.
Michael: Just...
Jan: Is it really that important to you?
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: Alright.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: Go by yourself.
Michael: Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
Jan: Well...
Michael: Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
Jan: What? No Michael!
Michael: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1658]

Michael: So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Jim: Sure we'll go.
Michael: Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Jim: Oh I'm sorry.  What?
Pam: One of the tickets is for him.
Michael: Just let me know who the winner is.
Pam and Jim: Not it.
Jim: Nope.
Pam: I won.
Jim: Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Pam: Tie goes to the girlfriend.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1659]

Michael: Alright.  I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
Jim: I'm driving?
Michael: Yes.  Thank you.
Jim: Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Michael: Oh yeah, you'd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.    I love ya Pam... okay.    I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I'll be back.  I'll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
Angela: Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
Michael: If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Dwight: Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
DunMiff/sys:  Oh.  I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.
Dwight: I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1660]

Michael: You ever read this? 
Jim: Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Michael: Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Same sort of stuff in here.
Jim: It's not.  It's different.  But it's a good book.
Michael: Mmwa.  Mmwa.
Jim: What was that?
Michael: Leaving Pennsylvania.
Jim: Oh.  Two kisses.
Michael: One for me one for Jan.
Jim: Gotcha.
Michael: You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That'd be fun.  Friday?
Jim: That would be fun.
Michael: Wanna come over Friday?
Jim: Uhhh.  Can't.
Michael: After work you guys...
Jim: Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
Michael: Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
Jim: Mmmkay...
Michael: What are you doing?
Jim: Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
Michael: No.
Jim: Yep.
Michael: No, I'm sure that's not.  Na...
Jim: Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Yep.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1661]

Michael: Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1662]

Michael: You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1663]

Michael: Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Jim: Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
Michael: Yeah.  I withdrew too.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1664]

Michael: Alright who wants to party?
Oscar: Why aren't you in New York?
Michael: Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
Stanley: You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
Michael: I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Angela: Thank you.
Michael: Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight?
Andy: He beat the computer.
Michael: Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1665]

Michael: This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1666]

Michael: How we doing on time?
Angela: The party starts in an hour.
Michael: Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Angela: Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
Michael: Mmmhmm.
Angela: Something made of ice?
Michael: Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
Angela: Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
Michael: I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
Angela: Chocolates?  Someone famous?
Michael: Yes
Angela: Cool music.
Michael: Uh...
Angela: Confetti.
Michael: I want it...
Angela: Go-Go dancers?
Michael: I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'
Angela: I can't do this.
Michael: Yes you can.
Angela: I can't do it.
Michael: Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
Angels: Okay.  Okay.
Michael: No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza!


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1667]

Michael: Good news.
Stanley: We get to go home?
Michael: Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
All: 
Kevin: Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Michael: Same thing.
Kevin: No, no.
All: 
Michael: You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Kevin: Oscar, talk to him.
Oscar: Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?
Michael: Pizza by Alfredo.
All: 
Michael: Okay, okay, what's better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
All: Medium amount of good pizza.
Michael: 


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1668]

Michael: Yup.
Pam: The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
Michael: You don't have to say it like that.
Pam: I said it normal.
Michael: Hey
Pizza guy: Hey.  Sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.
Michael: Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Pizza guy: The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.
Michael: Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
Pizza guy: I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy.
Michael: You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Oscar: It's not pizza.
Michael: Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
Pizza guy: 
Michael:  What do you mean hmm-um?
Pizza guy: Not my problem.
Michael: It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
Pizza guy: Great story.  It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.
Michael: I'm not giving that to you.
Pizza guy: Well then you're not getting you're pizzas.
Michael: No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out.
Pizza guy: What?
Michael: You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
Pizza guy: I'm not going in there.
Michael: Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
Pizza guy: This is stupid.
Michael: No, you don't even know what stupid is.  It's about to get all stupid up in here.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1669]

Michael: You ready to give me my discount now?
Pizza guy: No.
Michael: Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
Pizza guy: What kind of business is this?
Dwight: We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Michael: Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
Pizza guy: You better think about what you're doing.
Michael: No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Pizza guy: Sales?
Michael: Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.
Pizza guy: You're such a loser.
Dwight: What did you just call him?
Pizza guy: A loser.
Dwight: What did you say?
Pizza guy: A loser.
Michael: Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Dwight: I can make him talk, Michael.
All: Michael, Michael
Michael: Stop talking all at once!


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1670]

Jim: You need to let him go.
Michael: Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Jim: Yes.
Michael: You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Jim: Yes, but not by kidnapping.
Michael: I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
Jim: As a hostage.
Michael: I think you're over-thinking it.
Jim: I think you're under-thinking it.
Michael: Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
Jim: Ransom.
Michael: Trouble.  Okay, alright.
Jim: What did he say?
Michael: He said no.
Jim: So, we should let him go.
Michael: No, no.
Jim: Okay.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1671]

Kevin: What's going on?
Jim: Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Michael: Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
Kevin: We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1672]

Oscar: Thank God.
Pam: Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
Michael: I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Jim: Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Pam: I'm all over it.
Jim: Okay.
Jim: What have we got here?
Kevin: Good pizza.
Jim: Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
Kevin: Different stuff.
Jim: Which one's this? Perfect.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1673]

Manager: Can I start talking?  Is this thing on?  Give me a signal when you want me to start.
Ryan: And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Michael: Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
Ryan: Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
Pizza guy: If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will.  I'm a minor.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1674]

Michael: Hey, have you seen Jim?
Kevin: I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Dwight: Ahh-chaa!
Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Dwight: I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Pizza guy: I can hear you, man.
Dwight: Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Michael: Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
Dwight: You had to, what other choice did you have?
Michael: I could have paid for the pizza.
Dwight: Well, yeah.
Michael: Oh my God, oh my God.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1675]

Michael: This is Michael.
Ryan: Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
Michael: You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Ryan: Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... 
Michael:  Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
Dwight: What will you do?
Michael: I will open the door.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
Dwight: So, I'm paying full price?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
Michael: See ya, drive safely.
Michael:  Okay.
Dwight: Now what?
Michael: Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
Dwight: Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Michael: Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1676]

Michael: What a horrible day.
Dwight: Blah.
Michael: Bluh.
Dwight: Uhh.
Michael: Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I'd really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
Dwight: What?
Michael: I'm going to get it.
Dwight: Coopers has calamari.
Michael: Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
Dwight: Tokyo?
Michael: New York.  Wanna go?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Alright, you drive.
Dwight: Okay.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1677]

Dwight: Nice.
Michael: Here we go.
Dwight: Woo-hoo.
Michael: Mmm.
Dwight: Yum.
Bartender: I'm sorry, you guys are going to have to leave.
Michael: Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let's go.
Man: Hey, you're the Scranton guy.
Michael: Guilty.
Man: I liked your statement tonight.
Michael: Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
Man: Oh, very cool.  It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.
Michael: Yeah.
Man: See you later.
Dwight: Later on.
Michael:  I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
Dwight: And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Michael: I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
Dwight: I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Michael: I made it with my cheese pita.
Dwight: I date Indian girls.
Michael: I started a fire, I started a fire.
Dwight: Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Michael: And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
Dwight: I don't get that, I don't understand that.
Michael: Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
Michael: Wanna head back?
Dwight: Yeah, let's go.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1678]

Michael: What's wrong with me?
Pam: Excuse me?
Michael: I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.   Don't avoid this.  I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.
Pam: Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.
Michael: What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...
Pam:  The city mirrors, or the...?
Michael: The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.
Pam: The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
Michael: Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?
Pam: Put cold tea bags on your eyes.
Michael: Really?
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: That's it?
Pam: Mmhmm.
Michael: All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin' it.  Nn... no.


[Date: October 12, 2007, Session #1679]

Michael:  Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?


[Date: October 18, 2007, Session #1680]

Michael: Coat! 


[Date: October 18, 2007, Session #1681]

Michael: Steak! Where's my steeaaak?


[Date: October 18, 2007, Session #1682]

Michael: Get me Armani.
Pam: A suit?
Michael: On the phone.
Pam: Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
Michael: Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. 


[Date: October 18, 2007, Session #1683]

Michael: I owe you an apology.
Pam: You finished the movie.
Michael: Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
Pam: No. Go ahead.
Michael: Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1684]

Michael: So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.
Jan: You do.
Michael: I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
Jan: Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
Michael: We already have a sofa. So why do---
Jan: A futon's not a sofa.
Michael: It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
Jan: I know what a futon is, Michael.
Michael: I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
Jan: It costs what it costs.
Michael: No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.
Jan: We have gone through this.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1685]

Michael: Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1686]

Michael: It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- 
Pam:  Michael, it's Ryan for you.
Jan: Conniving little runt. Put him through.
Michael: Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
Ryan:  I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
Michael: Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
Ryan: I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Michael: Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
Ryan: Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
Michael:  Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1687]

Jan: So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
Michael: Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
Jan: Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1688]

Michael: Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1689]

Kevin: The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Michael: You can not, I have a thing tonight.
Kevin: Dammit.
Jim: Uh, Michael.
Michael: What?
Jim: That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
Michael: Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
Jim: Darn it!
Pam: Shoot!
Michael: How about this weekend?
Jim: No, can't.
Pam: We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
Michael: Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
Jim: Where are you going out tonight?
Michael: You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
Jim: I wouldn't understand or a secret?
Pam: You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.

Michael: I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1691]

Michael: I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
Nick: What's going on here?
Michael: Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
Nick: We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---
Michael: No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1692]

Nick: Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.
Michael: These meetings are useless.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1693]

Nick: I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?
Michael: Very inspirational. 
Nick: We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.
Co-Worker 1: Or a woman.
Michael: Or a trained seal. 
Nick: You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok? 


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1694]

Michael: Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
Stanely:  Yes, who is this?
Michael: I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
Stanely: Michael?
Michael: ...Stanley?
Stanley: Why are you calling me here at home?
Michael:  Senor, are you happy with your---
Stanley: Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
Michael:  Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
Stanley: Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? 


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1695]

Michael: Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
Nick:  My office.
Michael: You bet.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1696]

Nick: Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.
Michael: Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
Nick: A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
Michael: It is not a waste of our time.
Nick: This is a trading game.
Michael: No.
Nick: You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.
Michael: Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
Nick: Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.
Michael: Well, I hope this conversation has helped.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1697]

Michael: What did you get tonight?
Vikram: Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.
Michael: Oh, that looks good.
Vikram: Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?
Michael: I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
Vikram: Enjoy.
Michael: Thank you.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1698]

Vikram: I was a surgeon back home.
Michael: Really?
Vikram: Oh yeah.
Michael: Wonder what I would've been back home?
Vikram: Well this is your home.
Michael: I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
Vikram: Uhh, no.
Michael: I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1699]

Michael: You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
Co-Worker 2: Dude, you should review movies. 
Michael: I actually wrote a movie.
Co-Worker 3: Really?
Michael: I'm writing one, yeah.
Co-Worker 3: What's it about?
Michael: Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
Nick: What's so captivating?  I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.


[Date: October 19, 2007, Session #1700]

Co-Worker 2: Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?
Co-Worker 3: We'd love for you to come, Michael.
Michael: Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
Co-Worker 2: All right, next time dude.
Michael: Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin'?
Jan: You drive, I had too much wine.
Michael: Okay. How's yoga?
Jan: I didn't go.
Michael: Wh-Why not?
Jan: I just didn't!
Michael: Okay.
Jan: How was improv?
Michael: Good night Vikram.
Vikram: Good night.
Michael: Hey, congrats on the bonus.
Vikram: Thank you Michael.
Michael: I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
Vikram: Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah.
Michael: Good night.
Vikram: Good night.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1701]

Ryan: Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
Michael: Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
Ryan: Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
Michael: Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1702]

Michael: Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1703]

Michael: And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
Ryan: Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
Michael: Why?
Ryan: You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
Michael: No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
Ryan: I'm your boss.
Michael: My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
Ryan: You have another job?
Michael: What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
Jim: Are you a cocktail waitress?
Ryan: You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
Michael: It won't.
Ryan: It did, all ready.
Michael: Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. 
Kelly: You're so funny.
Ryan: Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Kelly: I invited him.
Ryan: It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
Darryl: There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
Kelly: Okay. 
Darryl: Hey, get off.
Kelly: Umm, see you later tonight.
Darryl: I have plans later.
Kelly: Okay, bye honey.
Ryan: How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Michael: Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
Ryan: You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
Michael: Huh, okay.
Ryan: What?
Michael: It's whoever, not whomever.
Ryan: No, it's whomever.
Michael: No, whomever is never actually right.
Jim: No, sometimes its right.
Creed: Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
Andy: No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
Oscar: Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
Michael: Not a native speaker.
Kevin: I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Ryan: Do you really know which one is correct?
Kevin: I don't know.
Pam: It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
Phyllis: Yeah, that sounds right.
Michael: Well it sounds right, but is it?
Stanley: How did Ryan use it? As an object?
Ryan: As an object.
Kelly: Ryan used me an object.
Stanley: Is he right about that?
Pam: How did he use it again?
Toby: It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
Michael: Thank you.
Toby: To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
Michael: No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
Ryan: Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1704]

Michael: I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1705]

Michael: Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
Mr. Figaro: Lipophedrine
Michael: And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
Mr. Figaro: Never heard of it.
Michael: In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this.
Mr. Figaro: Are you quitting?
Michael: I am.
Mr. Figaro: Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1706]

Michael: I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1707]

Michael: Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
Kevin: I do gamble Michael.
Michael: Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
Kevin: The mob.
Michael: Do you know anybody in the mob?
Kevin: 
Michael: Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1708]

Phyllis: He's always been terrible with money.
Stanley: I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
Kevin: Yeah, women be shoppin'.
Meredith: I can't believe he has a second job.
Oscar: He's not even good at his first one.
Michael: Hey guys.
Kevin: Shh.
Michael: What'cha talking about?    Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
Pam: Michael.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey.
Oscar: Michael, are you having money problems?
Michael: Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
Oscar: You heard me correctly.
Michael: Oh, I hate monkeys.
Pam: What's going on, why do you have a second job?
Michael: I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
Pam: Doesn't Jan have money?
Michael: I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
Kevin: True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
Michael: I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? 
Oscar and Stanley: You just put it back in your pocket.
Michael: Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1709]

Creed: Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
Michael: No you didn't.
Creed: Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1710]

Michael: How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
Creed: You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
Michael: That is a good point.
Creed: Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
Michael: Like the witness protection program.
Creed: Exactly.
Oscar: Not at all.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1711]

Michael: I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That's the life.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1712]

Michael: I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1713]

Oscar: Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Michael: I didn't say it, I declared it.
Oscar: Still, that's not anything.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1714]

Oscar: This is a lot of credit card debt.
Michael: Yeah, tell me about it.
Oscar: Mmm.
Michael: You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
Oscar: Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
Michael: Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
Oscar: Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Michael: That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1715]

Oscar: Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
Michael: Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
Oscar: The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
Michael: Right.
Oscar: This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
Michael: How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1716]

Oscar: Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
Michael: No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
Oscar: She has to know.
Michael: We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Oscar: Michael, this is a presentation tool.
Michael: You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
Oscar: I'm done!
Michael: No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
Oscar: Jan is smart.
Michael: She poses.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1717]

Oscar: So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Jan:  You're broke?
Michael: Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
Jan:  Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.
Oscar: Jan.
Jan:  Yeah, what?
Oscar: Michael left.
Jan:  Okay, where did he go?
Oscar: I don't know.
Jan:  Well, is he coming right back?
Oscar: I don't think so.
Jan:  I'll be right there.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1718]

Michael: What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1719]

Michael:  Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I'm never coming back.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: Hey Jan.
Jan: What's going on?
Michael: Not much, what's up with you?
Jan: Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?
Michael: I'm out of answers Jan.
Jan: What does that mean?
Michael: I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
Jan: Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won't solve anything.  You know that.
Michael: I don't know that.
Jan: Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
Michael: I'll stay off the grid.
Jan: Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It's not that bad.
Michael: Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
Jan: Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
Michael: That's really nice of you to say.
Jan: Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?
Michael: I think the engineer left.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1720]

Michael: Don't sell your implants please.
Jan: I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
Michael: That's nice though.
Jan: It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
Michael: It looks cute though.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1721]

Michael: I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...
Dwight: No,  I don't know.
Michael: Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... 
Dwight: What?
Michael: What do you mean, 'what'?
Dwight: What... 
Michael: Were you listening to what I was saying?
Dwight: I was aware that you were speaking.
Michael: What is the matter with you?
Dwight: What is the matter with... me?
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: I'm... discombobulated.
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: I need help.
Michael: All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please. 


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1722]

Oscar: Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
Michael: Yeah.  What?
Oscar: I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
Michael: Um, my CDs.
Oscar: You have CDs?
Michael: I do.
Oscar: Okay, good, okay.  What bank?
Michael: My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic
Oscar:  Case Logic.
Michael: And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor   What?
Oscar: I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1723]

Michael: I've been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn't even like.  No. 


[Date: October 20, 2007, Session #1724]

Jan: I just think that...
Michael: I can't.
Jan: Why?
Michael: I can't go back to that.
Jan: I think you can.  I... what?
Michael: I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
Jan: All right, well then maybe there's another way, you know?  I mean, we could just... we'll think of something else.
Michael: We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.
Jan: Well... well, we will.
Michael: I have...
Jan: We just will.
Michael: Okay.  What?  Um...
Jan: I have some ideas.
Michael: Tell me.
Jan:  I am not going to tell you yet.
Michael: Well, please?  I won't tell anybody.
Jan: Oh, yes, you will.
Michael: Yeah, I will.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1725]

Michael: Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
Phyllis: Dancing babies!
Michael: Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1726]

Michael: We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1727]

Andy: Best ad ever.  Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
Jim: Nobody tell him!
Andy: What? No, why?
Jim: You got it, you're so close!
Andy:  Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
Jim: Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
Andy: Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
Jim: Nope.
Andy: Football cream. Grr!
Michael: Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
Pam: I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
Michael: Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1728]

Michael: Hello hello!
Ad guy 1: Hey, how ya doin'?
Michael: Michael Scott.
Ad guy 2: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Regional manager.
Ad guy 2: Hey Michael, nice to meet you
Michael: Excited to talk ideas.
Ad guy 1: Let's do it, man.
Michael: You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
Ad guy 1: That sounds great.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1729]

Michael: All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
Michael: I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
Andy: Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
Michael: He gives the best back rubs in the office.
Andy: It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
Michael: Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
Stanley: Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
Michael: Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
Michael: These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
Kevin:  Mama Bear!
Michael: Who else?


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1730]

Michael:  Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.  But we zoom back further---
Ad guy 1: Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---
Michael: Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
Ad guy 1: That all sounds really, really ambitious.
Michael: Yeah, I know.
Ad guy 1: Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
Michael: Mmm. Okay. 
Michael: That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.
Ad guy 1: That's what we came up with.
Michael: Well we can do better than that.
Ad guy 2: Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.
Ad guy 1: Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
Michael: The waving?
Ad guy 1: Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1731]

Receptionist: You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
Ryan: Hello?
Michael:  Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek!  I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.
Ryan: What?
Michael: Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
Ryan: I told you not to call about small problems.
Michael: Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
Ryan: That's good. They're creative, you're not.
Michael: I'm creative, Ryan.
Ryan: It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
Michael: Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
Ryan: Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
Michael: Yeah!
Ryan: But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
Michael: Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1732]

Michael: All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1733]

Michael: Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
Ad guy 2: Okay, when should we come back?
Michael: How about never hundred hours, sir.
Ad guy 2: We were sent here to help out.
Ad guy 1: Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude.
Michael: Hey thanks. Thank you.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1734]

David Wallace:  Michael, David Wallace.  What is this about dismissing the ad people?
Michael: Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
Ryan: I'm on Michael.
Michael: What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
David Wallace: This is weird.
Michael: I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
David Wallace: Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.
Michael: Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1735]

Michael: Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
Jim: Who are you talking to, specifically?


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1736]

Michael: We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1737]

Phyllis:  Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
Michael: Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Phyllis: Okay.
Andy: Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
Creed: She's crazy hot.
Andy: Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
Angela: That's not happening.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1738]

Phyllis: Bye everyone.
Michael: Line it up Phyllis.
Creed: Get her Phyll.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1739]

Darryl:  Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Darryl: Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs.
Darryl: Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Darryl: Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Michael: Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Darryl: What's rap?
Michael: Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.
Darryl: Great.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1740]

Darryl:  Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Darryl: Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Michael: Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
Darryl: You're right, it's better than you! It's us!  Dunder Mifflin.
Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly: The people person's paper people.
Michael: No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.
Darryl: You're on your own, Mike. 
Michael: Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
Darryl: You just said you hated it.
Michael: No. I said I hate the, the style.


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1741]

Andy:  Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
Michael: Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
Andy: Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
Michael: Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
Phyllis:  Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
Michael: That'a girl.
Phyllis: So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
Michael: Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
Phyllis:  No.
Michael: Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? 


[Date: October 21, 2007, Session #1742]

Michael: I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. 
Pam:  Yes?
Michael: Pam, please clear my phone lines.
Pam: Certainly.  Okay, clear.
Michael: They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call.


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1743]

Michael:  Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1744]

Everyone:  Oh! 
Bartender: Hey it seemed like a big hit.
Michael: No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1745]

Kevin: Michael, that was fun.
Michael: That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1746]

Michael: All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?
Toby: Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it'll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business. 
Michael: There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
Toby: I spent three years in advertising before I came here.
Michael: And that is probably why most ads suck.  Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film.   Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: About dressing your best today?
Pam: Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.
Michael: Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
Pam: Yeah, I get all the memos. 
Michael: Okay, good. Good.


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1747]

Michael: This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.    Who else?  Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.
Ad guy 1: Sure.
Ad guy 2: Right.
Michael: And if not we can just make him disappear.  This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
Jim: I don't want -
Michael: No, that's skeptical. Do sad.
Jim: Mmm...
Michael: That's, that's a pirate movie.  That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.
Ad guy 1:  Yeah... no.  
Michael: And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. 


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1748]

Michael: All right, let's start.
Jim: All right!   I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Michael: You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
Jim: Yup.
Michael: Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...
Jim: Right.
Michael: ...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.
Jim: Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
Michael: We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
Jim: Love it.
Michael: And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.
Jim: Mm, can't do that.
Michael: Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
Jim: Definitely can't do that.
Michael: Bull man!
Jim: You know what?
Michael: This is bull!
Jim: Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
Michael: Ahhhh!  
Jim: I'm just doing my job, man.
Michael: If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
Jim: Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... 
Michael: No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't...
Jim: What?  What?
Michael: No, I can do it.
Jim: What?
Michael: I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.   Please give me it.
Jim: Okay, make a commercial.
Michael:  Do you want this open or closed?
Jim: Closed. 


[Date: October 31, 2007, Session #1749]

Michael: Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?
Everyone: 
Michael: I can't hear you!   Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
Dwight: We had already applauded.
Michael: Okay, okay.  Who could do music?
Pam: How about Darryl?
Michael: Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1750]

Michael: This is perfect.
Dwight: He looks like your twin.
Michael: This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
Dwight: I will know.
Michael: But, you will not tell anyone.
Dwight: I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
Michael: Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.    Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
Stanley: I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
Michael: Just go out, and come back in.
Stanley: I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
Michael: What?


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1751]

Michael: Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
All: 
Michael: No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
Jim: Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
Michael: Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
Stanley: I think it's because of my sales record.
Michael: That could not possibly be it.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1752]

Michael: You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1753]

Michael: How can I get you to stay?
Stanley: Money.
Michael: Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
Stanley: Money.
Michael: Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
Stanley: Money.
Michael: Pssh, kay.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1754]

Karen:  Hello?
Michael: Fillipellers, how's it hanging?
Karen: Michael...
Michael: To the left?
Karen: Listen, I-
Michael: To the right?
Karen: I'm-
Michael: Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
Karen: You called me.
Michael: Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
Karen: I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Michael: No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
Karen: Toby's not a salesperson.
Michael: You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
Karen: Oooh.  Good-bye Michael.
Michael: Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1755]

Pam: I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
Michael: Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
Ben: Hi Michael.
Michael: I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Ben: Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
Pam: 
Michael:  Get out.  Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
Ben: Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden.  Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?
Michael: No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
Ben: Seriously?


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1756]

Michael: What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1757]

Dwight: Found him!
Michael: Jim, we're getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
Jim: So what are you going to do?
Michael: What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
Jim: Did they?
Michael: Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
Pam: It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
Michael: That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright?  Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1758]

Jim: We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
Michael: What? What? We did?
Dwight and Michael: Surprise!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Michael: Look at his face! Look at his face!
Jim: What are we doing?
Dwight: Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
Michael: What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Dwight: Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Michael: We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
Jim: We're going to Utica?
Michael: Uh-huh.
Jim: I'm not going to Utica right now.
Michael: Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.
Jim: No.
Michael: We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
Michael and Dwight:  Utica! Utica! Utica!


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1759]

Michael and Dwight:  Utica! Utica!
Michael: In your face
Dwight: Yow!
Jim: I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Michael: Are you calling Karen?
Jim: No, I'm not calling Karen.
Dwight: He's lying.
Michael: Yep, get it.
Jim: What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
Dwight:  Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Jim: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: No communication with the outside world Jim.
Michael: It had to be done, it had to be done.
Jim: Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Dwight: Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1760]

Jim: Okay.
Michael: Hey Dwight, he found it.
Jim: You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Michael: Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
Jim: Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
Michael: Do you really wanna know?
Jim: Oh, God. 
Michael: Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
Dwight: Or real bombs.
Michael: No, no, not real bombs.
Dwight: Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Michael: Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
Jim: No.
Michael: It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.
Jim: No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Dwight: Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Jim: Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
Michael: Teach her to offer Stanley more money.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1761]

Michael: So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
Jim: What?
Michael: I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
Jim: Okay, you know what?
Michael: ...awesome.
Jim: Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Michael: Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.'  'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
Jim: It doesn't matter.
Michael: I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Jim: Doesn't matter.
Michael: Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
Jim: That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
Michael: What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
Dwight: I'm peeing in this empty can.
Jim: Oh my God!
Michael: Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
Dwight: Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Jim: Michael, watch the road!
Dwight: Hey, you're making me spray!
Michael: I'll kill you man!
Jim: Michael! Michael, pull over!
Michael: That is just so disgusting!
Jim: Pull over, pull over!
Dwight: I think I cut my penis on the lid!


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1762]

Jim: I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
Dwight: Believe it.
Michael: Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
Jim: No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
Michael: Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down.  You and I-
Jim: Guy's going by. Shh.
Michael: You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
Dwight: And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
Jim: No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Dwight: Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Jim: Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
Dwight: Okay, Jim.
Jim: Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Dwight: Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
Jim: Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1763]

Michael:  We are in a stairwell.
Dwight:  We are climbing some stairs.
Dwight: I'm breathing heavily.
Jim: Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
Dwight: Well...
Michael: There's a guy, there's a guy.
Dwight: There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
Michael: Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
Dwight: I can see the security guard's eyes.
Jim: No, no, don't do anything to them.
Dwight: I have to do something to his eyes.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1764]

Jim: Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
Michael: We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
Jim: Isn't that thing huge?
Michael: It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
Jim: No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Michael: Aha! 
Dwight: My hip bone!
Michael: We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
Dwight: Don't leave us!
Michael: Save yourself!
Dwight: Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Jim: Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
Michael: Dwight, you gotta move!
Jim: Damn it guys!
Michael: Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
Dwight: I'm losing control of my bladder.
Jim: Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Dwight: Did you say Karen?
Michael: Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
Jim: No, I'm not doing that.
Michael: Just say you wanna get back together.
Jim: No, I'm not doing that!
Michael: It doesn't have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
Karen: Jim?
Jim: Hey Karen.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1765]

Karen: Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Dwight: Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Karen: I'm taking Stanley.
Dwight: Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Michael:  Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. 
Karen: Jim, hang on a second?
Jim: Yes?
Karen: So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
Jim: Yeah, trying to quit though.
Karen: If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Jim: Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Karen: 
Jim: I mean, it's just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Karen: Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Jim:  Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
Karen: Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Jim: I... will... 


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1766]

Michael: We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1767]

Michael: Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart.  I can't do this.
Stanley: Michael?  A word?
Michael: Of course.
Stanley: I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
Michael: Really?


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1768]

Michael: Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.

Michael: Woo!  Shotgun!
Jim: Well, you're driving, right?
Michael: Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
Jim: Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
Dwight: Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
Michael: No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You're gonna sit in the back left  where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.
Dwight: Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Michael: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car.
Dwight: Woohoo!


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1770]

Security guard: They sprayed me in the eye. 
Dwight:  Scranton rules! 
Michael: Dwight!  Stop it!    Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.


[Date: November 1, 2007, Session #1771]

Michael: Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.
Dwight: Pam is down for anything.
Jim: You embarrassed me.
Michael: You embarrassed us.
Dwight: Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.

[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1772]

Toby: I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
Meredith: I love camping.  Anything can happen.
Toby: Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. 
Michael: Morning.
Toby: Michael.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1773]

Toby: Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience 
Michael:  Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Toby: Michael wasn't invited.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1774]

Michael: Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?  Not real.
Jim: Got it.
Michael: So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
Jim: Absolutely, yes.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1775]

Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah?
Michael: Oh, you wanna go today?


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1776]

Jim: Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Michael: How often can you actually donate blood?
Jim: Is there a limit?
Michael: Your body only has a certain amount.
Jim: Well, is that it? Or?
Michael: Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
Jim: How so?
Michael: A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? 
Jim: What's that?
Michael: Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
Jim: Right.
Michael: In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
Jim: Not gonna change.
Michael: I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
Jim: I thought we had that looked at.
Michael: I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1777]

Michael: When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1778]

Michael: OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
Dwight:  I'm on it. 
Michael: OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what...
Dwight: Let's see if any of these will work. 
Michael: Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1779]

Michael: Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
Pam: Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Michael: No.
Pam: Great.
Michael: Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Pam: Oh.
Michael: Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
Jim: Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Michael: Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
Jim: OK, great.
Michael: This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
Jim: Yup.
Michael: When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
Jim: That'd be great.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1780]

Michael: This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
Dwight: No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Michael: Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
Dwight: I would make sure that you were dead.
Michael: Well...
Dwight: First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Michael: You...
Dwight: And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Michael: You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.
Dwight: What are you doing?
Michael: I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been---  Ow! What are you doing?
Dwight: It would be better if you were unconscious.
Michael: No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Dwight: Do you want to do this right or not?
Michael: Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1781]

Michael:  Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1782]

Michael:  Happy Birthday!
Kelly: Ahhh!! 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1783]

Michael:  Happy Birthday!
Oscar: Ahhh! 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1784]

Michael:  Happy Birthday!
Phyllis: Oh! 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1785]

Dwight: We're here. 
Michael: Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
Dwight:  Here we go. Just the two of us 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1786]

Dwight: Good a spot as any. 
Michael: What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
Dwight: I'm just --
Michael: Stop.
Dwight: Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction.  Behold.
Michael: Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
Michael: Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. 
Dwight: Good luck, Michael.
Michael: Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1787]

Michael:  Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.  OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1788]

Michael: There we go.  Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1789]

Michael: I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1790]

Michael: See, this is a beautiful piece of material  This could be used for all sorts of things.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1791]

Michael: Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1792]

Michael: I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me.  Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1793]

Michael: Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1794]

Michael: I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday.  Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1795]

Michael: Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy  may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1796]

Michael: Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those  are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. 
Dwight: Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo!  Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. 


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1797]

Everybody: Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday  to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. 
Michael: Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1798]

Michael: Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out.  I can also make it the sky.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1799]

Michael: Hey, buddy.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: What up?
Jim: Sure glad you're back.
Michael: You are relieved.
Jim: You have no idea.
Michael: So what did I miss?
Jim: Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Michael: Oh.
Jim: So, terrible idea.
Michael: Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
Jim: You did do it?
Michael: Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
Jim: Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Michael: That's what I said. That's what she said.
Jim: That's what who said?
Michael: I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
Jim: That's what she said.
Michael: Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1800]

Michael: Come in!
Pam: Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?
Michael: Pam, are you my friend?
Pam: Oh, no.
Michael: We have been friends forever, right?
Pam: Yes, I have been working with you forever.
Michael: Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
Pam: I don't think so.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1801]

Michael: Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?
Pam: I do.
Michael: So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
Pam: No.
Michael: Thank you for your honesty.
Pam: You're welcome.  Open or closed?
Michael: Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?
Pam: No.
Michael: Can you send Dwight in here?
Pam: Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. 
Dwight: You wanted to see me?
Michael: Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss.   Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?
Dwight: I'm on it.


[Date: November 8, 2007, Session #1802]

Dwight: And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Michael: All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.
Dwight: Don't you want a sheath for that?
Michael: No, just get me a case.   All right.
Dwight: Anything else?  Flint...
Michael: MmMmm.  All I need...
Dwight: Parka...
Michael: No, Dwight!
Dwight: Tent, rainfly, gorp...
Michael: I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
Dwight: Mmmnnnnmmm...
Michael:  What is this called again?

[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1803]

Oscar: So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- 
Michael: I'll call back.
Kevin: You never call back.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1804]

Michael:  Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1805]

Jan: 
Michael: You can't always work 200 days though.
Michael:  Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. 


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1806]

Ryan: You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
Michael: Yep.
Ryan: I can get you a tutor if you need- 
Michael: Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
Ryan: Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Michael: N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
Ryan: Take the call, friend.
Michael: I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
Ryan: I insist you take your work calls.
Michael: Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1807]

Jan: I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
Michael: Yeah, I hate that.
Jan: Good.
Michael: So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
Jan: And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Michael: Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
Jan: Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
Michael: Well-
Jan: Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
Michael: Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Jan: Does this work for you?
Michael: Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
Jan: Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
Michael: Million dollars!
Jan: Four million.
Michael: Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
Jan: No, Michael. Oh, come on.
Michael: Perfect crime.
Jan: Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
Michael: Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
Jan: Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
Michael: I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
Jan: All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1808]

Michael: Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Lester: A good start. And I think it's busload.
Michael: Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Ryan: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey hey.
Ryan: I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1809]

Ryan: Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Michael: I would love that.
Ryan: Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
Michael: Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
Ryan: Good. That is great to hear.
Michael: It is.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1810]

Diane Kelly: Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel.
Michael: Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
Diane: Toby?
Michael: Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Toby: Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
Michael: Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
Jan: Michael, just relax, okay?
Diane: You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So..
Michael: Okay. All right.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1811]

Deposition Reporter: Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Michael: Yessh.
Lester: Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination?
Michael: Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Lester: Oh. Very good. Well put.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1812]

Lester: How long have you known the plaintiff?
Michael: I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
Lester: How long have you known Ms. Levinson?
Michael: Six years and two months.
Lester: And you were directly under her the entire time?
Michael: That's what she said.
Lester: Excuse me?
Michael: That's what she said.
Lester: Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?
Michael: Uh, wh-why would she say that?
Jan: Can we just move on to another question?
Diane: No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?
Lester: With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.
Michael: Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Jan: Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
Lester: Oh, are you sure?
Jan: Uh, yes.
Lester: Can you go back to where this digression began?
Deposition Reporter:  Mr. Schneider: And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott: That's what she said.
Michael: Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1813]

Lester: Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?
Michael: She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
Lester: Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?
Michael: Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
Lester: You don't need to go any further. Her breasts.
Michael: Yes.
Lester: She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?
Michael: Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
Lester: What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?
Michael: Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
Lester: Interesting. How so?
Michael: Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. 
Diane: Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?
Michael: I will allow it.
Diane: Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please. 
Michael: Uh...
Diane: That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?
Michael: Uh-huh.
Diane: And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?
Michael: Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
Diane: Wait, excuse me?
Michael: If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
Lester: Could we take a short break?
Diane: No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?
Michael: Line.
Diane: I'm sorry, what?
Man: He asked for a line, like in a play.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1814]

Michael: Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
Diane Kelly: Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.
Lester: Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal.
Michael: Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Lester: This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. 'Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had sex with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had sex six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie.'
Michael: Irie.
Lester: Irie, sorry. 'More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael.' It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?
Diane Kelly: We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
Michael: I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
Diane Kelly: It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
Man: OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.
Toby: Um, can you make it eleven?
Man: Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1815]

Michael:  Can I sit here?
Toby:  ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted... 


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1816]

Michael: How can you give up my diary like that?
Jan: I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
Michael: How'd you even find it?
Jan: You keep it under my side of the mattress.
Michael: I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
Jan: Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
Michael: Fine. I love you.
Jan: I love you too.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1817]

Diane Kelly:  Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as 'Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way.'
Michael: Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
Lester: Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person.
Toby:  Excuse me.
Michael: Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
Diane Kelly: OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.
Michael: Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Diane Kelly: Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
Michael: That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.
Diane Kelly: Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please? 
Michael: March 17th.
Diane Kelly: And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
Michael: Yes.
Diane Kelly: You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.
Michael:  'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.'
Diane Kelly: Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
Michael: 
Diane Kelly: Mr. Scott?


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1818]

Michael: How can you do that to me?
Jan: 
Lester: You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record.
Jan: Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
Michael: Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
Jan: Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
Lester: Starting at paragraph 6. Council: 'Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, was he a contender to replace Jan Levinson?' David Wallace: 'Yes.'
Michael: See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Lester: Council: 'Was he your first choice?' David Wallace: 'Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years.'
Council: Was he in the top 5 of contenders?' David Wallace: 'What do you want me to say? Come on, he's a nice guy. There were many people that I considered.' Council: 'Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?' David Wallace: 'No.'
Lester: I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?
Michael: ...Absolutely not.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1819]

David: Michael. I am very sorry.
Michael: Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
David Wallace: No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
Michael:  Hey, David?
David: Yeah?
Michael: I think you're a nice guy too.
David: Thanks, Michael.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1820]

Michael: Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1821]

Michael:  What do you want to do for dinner?
Jan: How about Chinese?
Michael: Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Jan: That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
Michael: Do you fast food?
Jan: Fine, fast food's fine.


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1822]

Michael: I have some, uh, experience.  I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.
Man: Then you're an old hand at this.
Michael: Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.   Tell Meredith I said it another time .


[Date: November 15, 2007, Session #1823]

Michael: Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.
Man: Fine.  Please be brief.
Michael:  Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table.  I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere .  I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play.  But the point is, I have a sense of humor.   And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well.  Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend , my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax .  Good.  That feels good .  All right.  Everybody feel better?
Diane Kelly: Two years ago, when you quote 'kissed and fondled in the Chili's parking lot' , were you aware of company guidelines specifically discouraging that behavior?
Michael: Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.
Diane Kelly: Yeah, I'm sorry, that's not a word.
Michael: Ye-ohh.  Ye-no.
Diane Kelly: Okay.  Were you aware that when Jan was with you, she claimed to be visiting clients, or, uh, traveling to see her sister in Scottsdale?
Michael: Very nice! 
Diane Kelly: I'm sorry.  Excuse me?
Michael: High five! 
Jan: Sometimes when he gets nervous he, uh, talks like Borat.
Diane Kelly: Okay, Mr. Scott, would you mind, um, speaking in your normal voice for us.  Please.
Michael:  Can't stop.
Diane Kelly: Okay .
Michael: Forgot normal talk.

[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1824]

Stanley: This is ridiculous.
Phyllis: Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Michael: Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
Jim: Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Michael: Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
Dwight: Thank you Michael.
Michael: All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
Jim: I think you did.
Michael: I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
Jim: Oh, I-
Michael: You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1825]

Dwight: Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Michael: Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.

Michael: James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. 
Jan: When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
Jim: Just like that.
Jan: Just like that.
Jan: So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
Michael: Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
Jan:  Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
Michael: Well, I-
Jan: Shame on you.
Pam: What a cute bench.
Michael: Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
Jim: Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Michael: It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. 
Jan: See, he fits perfectly.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1828]

Michael: I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall.
Jim: Wow.
Michael: Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
Jim: What is that chestnut?
Michael: No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Jan: It's pine.
Jim: Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
Jan: Really?
Pam: Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
Michael: If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Jan: I bet you are.
Jim: Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Jan: It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said 'Honey keep the trophies.'
Michael: Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
Jan:  Oh, excuse us just a second.
Michael: I'll get it.
Jan:  So glad you're finally able to be here.
Angela:  No, no.
Michael: Okay.
Andy: Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner?  I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna!  These are for you. 
Jan: Oh, how thoughtful.
Michael: Very nice.
Andy: Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
Jan: Aw.
Angela: What am I supposed to do with this?
Jan: How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
Pam: Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Jan: Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
Pam: Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
Jan: You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
Michael: When in Rome.
Jan: Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
Michael: Whatever you say babe.
Jan: Follow me.
Michael: All right.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1829]

Hunter's CD: You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.
Michael: You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
Jan: Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
Angela: Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1830]

Jim: You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
Pam: Oh okay.
Michael: Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Jim: That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
Pam: Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
Jim: I don't know because I everything I own is there.
Pam: You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
Michael: That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
Andy: Michael, you're up.

[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1832]

Pam:  Oh, thank you.
Michael: You're welcome.
Jan:  I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
Michael: I don't like that story babe.
Jan: Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
Michael: Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
Jan: You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
Michael: Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
Angela: You shouldn't joke about that.
Pam: Is there more wine in the kitchen?
Jan: I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1833]

Michael:  So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
Jim: Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
Michael: Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that?
Andy: Thought about it, I'm in.
Jim: I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Michael: I'm sorry.  What now?


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1834]

Jan: Coming! 
Dwight: Hello.
Jan: What are you doing here?
Dwight: We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Pam:  Awesome.
Jan: What is he doing here?
Angela: Yes, What are you doing here?
Michael: Dwight is my friend.
Woman: We weren't invited?
Michael: You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Jan: Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
Michael: Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
Jan: We saw Wicked.
Michael: When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
Jan: I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay?  But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a ing kid.
Michael: Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? 
Jan: I hate my life.
Dwight: So can we come in?


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1835]

Dwight: Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Jan:  I'm just gonna check on dinner. 
Dwight: Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Angela: I hate beet salad.
Woman: It's actually really good.
Dwight: Hey hey hey hey.  I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
Angela: The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Michael:  Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
Pam:  Like... like what?
Michael: I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
Andy: Yeah it does.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1836]

Jan:  Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
Michael: You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Jan: Oops.
Michael: Excuse me for a second. 
Jim:  So... how do you guys know each other?
Woman: I was his babysitter.
Pam: And now you guys are dating?
Dwight: Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Jim: Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
Woman: E-mail?
Jim: Nevermind.
Michael: Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
Jim: That's nice.
Michael: Everybody enjoying their meal?
Jan: Hey babe?
Michael: Yeah?
Jan: How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
Michael: No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Jan: Ok. 
Michael:  Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
Jan: At least he's an artist.
Michael: BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Jan:  AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
Michael: NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Jan: FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
Michael: MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Jan: YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
Michael: OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
Jan: AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
Michael:  THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! 
Woman: I'm gonna get going.
Dwight: Fine. Get outta here.
Jim: It's getting late.
Michael: You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1837]

Jim:  Of course
Dwight: Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Officer 1: Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
Michael: Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
Officer 2: The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Michael: Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Officer 1: You wanna press charges?
Michael: Would she get into trouble?
Officer: Yes.  She'd be charged.
Michael: I will take the fall. I did it.
Officer 2: You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.
Jan:  Michael!  Michael. What are you doing to him?
Officer 1: Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?
Dwight:  Michael can come home with me.
Michael: Jim? Pam?
Jim: Oh... my apartment's on fire
Pam:  Flooded.
Jim: Flooded.
Dwight: You people.  Come on. You're sleeping with me.
Michael: No.
Dwight: I'm gonna take you home Michael.
Michael: Nope.
Dwight: Alright. 
Jan: Bye Babe!


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1838]

Michael: My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1839]

Jan: A little amuse-bouche, anyone?
Pam:  Food!
Jan: Okay, trivia!  Does anyone know what that means?
Andy: I believe it means mouth pleaser.
Jan: Oh!
Andy: It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'
Angela: Andy, was that coordinated by the Cornell Study Abroad Office?
Andy: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Angela: The reason I ask is that Andy went to Cornell.
Jan:  Ahh, did you wash your hands, babe?
Michael: Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one.  I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. 
Pam:  Not with your hands.
Michael:  They need to be presented... royally... anyone?
Andy: Mmm. 
Michael: Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.


[Date: April 10, 2008, Session #1840]

Michael: It's been a rough couple of weeks.
Jan: Well, I just got into a little trouble with the neighbors.
Michael: Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
Pam: Wow, you did neighborhood watch?
Michael: Yes.
Jan: I did, and I had a very late shift and I had a little bit of wine and I fell asleep.
Michael: So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...
Jan: Yeah.
Michael: And the neighbors blamed Jan.
Jan: Yeah.  But, you know, it was my fault.
Michael: It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...
Jan: Mm-hmm.
Michael: So...
Jan: Yeah.
Michael: Well.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1841]

Michael: Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
Phyllis: Yes.
Michael: Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1842]

Jim: That's the Christmas spirit.
Dwight: I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
Jim: Yes.
Michael: Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
Dwight: They are now.
Michael: Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1843]

Meredith:  Oh... my... GOD!!!   Hit me again.
Michael: Alright... One more time around the block.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1844]

Michael: Jim, Jim....
Jim: What is it?
Michael: That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
Jim: Wow, that is delicious.
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: Can't believe no ones thought of that.
Michael: I know.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1845]

Michael:  Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1846]

Oscar: We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Michael: Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
Oscar: What about February 2nd?
Jim: Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Michael: No, no. I celebrate privately.
Jim: That's cool.
Michael: Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
Oscar: Now? It's our Christmas party.
Michael: We'll do it quickly.
Jim: Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Michael:  What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
Oscar: Do you know how to do an intervention?
Michael: Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1847]

Michael: An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1848]

Michael: Okay, how do you feel?
Meredith: A little better. I threw up.
Michael: Uck... T.M.I.
Kevin: Fire girl.  Too soon?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
Toby: Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
Michael: I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
Meredith: I'm not an alcoholic.
Michael: Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. 
Dwight: Aye.
Michael: The aye's have it.
Meredith: I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
Michael: Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? 


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1849]

Michael: Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
Meredith: Sure.
Michael: Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
Meredith: Obviously.
Michael: Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
Oscar: Where did you get this?
Michael: I got it on a website, that's not important.
Toby: Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.
Michael: Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
Kelly: Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
Michael: Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin.
Kevin: Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Michael: That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
Kevin: Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Meredith: You're welcome.
Michael: Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?
Dwight: No, I like Meredith.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1850]

Michael: Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
Meredith: I am fine.
Michael: Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
Meredith: I know I drink. I like to party
Michael: I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
Meredith: I am not an alcoholic!
Michael: You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1851]

Meredith: I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Michael:  Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
Dwight: I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1852]

Michael: Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
Dwight: Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Michael: Dwight--
Dwight: She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Michael: ...okay.
Dwight: I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Jim: Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
Dwight: Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
Creed: I can get you one in an hour.
Dwight: Really?
Toby: Okay you know, this-- this is over.
Stanley: I agree.
Jim: Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Michael: Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1853]

Michael: You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1854]

Michael:  I'll be down in a minute.  Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
Toby: Sure. Wow.  Ow...


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1855]

Meredith: We just missed Poor Richards.
Michael: We did?
Meredith: Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Michael: Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
Meredith: The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
Michael: We could go there, sure.
Meredith: ...Brixx's, Carmen's...
Michael: Yes, yes.
Meredith: ...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
Michael: I have a new place.
Meredith: Well, it must have just opened up.
Michael: It-- yep, recently.
Meredith: Yeah... all right.
Michael: All right.
Meredith: Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music.   Yeah!
Michael: Yeah, oh there you go.
Meredith: Yeah!
Michael: That's good.
Meredith: Yeah that's better.
Michael: We're party girls.


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1856]

Meredith: Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Michael: It's okay. It's all right.
Meredith: No way!  There is no way! No way!
Michael: Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
Meredith: No way!  No way!  There is no way!
Michael: Here we go. This is gonna be good.
Meredith: No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Michael: Yes you are. 
Meredith: I am not going in there! NO!!
Meredith: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Michael: Shhh... just calm down.
Meredith:  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Michael:  Come on. Shh...
Meredith: No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
Michael: Here's the door. Here's the door.
Meredith: There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
Michael:  Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
Meredith: This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Rehab Nurse: Can I help you?
Michael: I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
Meredith: No! No! No! No! No!
Michael: So do I sign?
Meredith: NO!!!


[Date: December 23, 2008, Session #1857]

Michael: As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.


[Date: January 15, 2009, Session #1858]

Pam:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
Michael:  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!


[Date: January 15, 2009, Session #1859]

Dwight:  Aah!
Phyllis: Wow, thirteen!
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: No. No, no. There was wind.
Dwight: I was just jogging.
Michael: Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
Jim: No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
Michael: I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
Stanley: There was a car.
Michael: I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Oscar: Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
Michael: Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
Oscar: That's impossible.
Michael: Beat it!


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1860]

Michael: Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by  Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1861]

Pam: Quick announcement: new year, new candy.
Kevin: Whoo-hoo!
Pam: Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
Kevin: Hot tamales.
Pam: Yeah.
Kevin: Uh oh.
Pam: So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
Andy:  Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just...  No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
Michael: Wait, you still don't know...
Jim:  No, no. Nope.
Andy: Hmm?
Jim: Nothing.
Michael: You still don't know.
Jim: Why don't... Let's...
Michael:  What are you doing?
Jim: How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Michael: Andy.
Jim: Ahh! 
Andy: No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
Michael:  No, what I'm saying is...
Jim: No, no.
Michael: No, that's not it.
Jim: I know.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1862]

Michael:  How can he still not know?
Jim: We can't figure that out.
Michael: I can't take it anymore.
Dwight: Wait, what?  You can't take what?
Michael: I am telling Andy.
Dwight: No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
Michael: Who should it come from, then?
Everyone:  Angela.
Michael:  Are you still having intercourse with her? 
Oscar: What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
Michael: Did you ever have intercourse in this office? 
Oscar: Are you serious? Ugh. Where?  Where?  Where, Dwight?
Dwight:  Seems like you already know where.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1863]

Michael: Well?
Dwight: Not yet.
Jim: When?
Andy: When what?  When what?
Michael: You know this can't go on.
Andy: What can't go on?
Michael: We have to put an end to this.
Andy: Seems like...
Michael: Come on. 
Andy: You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1864]

Jim: This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
Dwight: Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
Michael: When will she be ready?
Dwight: I don't know.
Michael: Is she crazy in bed?
Dwight:  Yes.
Jim: Stop. What?
Michael: How so, specifically?
Jim: Okay, listen.
Dwight: Eager.
Jim: This shouldn't happen at work.
Dwight: And flexible.
Jim: And!
Michael: Really?
Jim: This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
Michael: It's too late.
Jim: Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
Michael: I am already walking.
Dwight: Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
Michael: Okay, what does that mean?
Dwight: Might get ugly.
Michael:  Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
Jim: But you're leaving...
Dwight:  Have a good trip.
Michael: Thanks.  Andy?
Andy: Yeah.
Michael: Walk with me.
Andy: Will do, boss-man.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1865]

Michael: Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...
Andy: You're not making any sense.
Michael: Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
Andy: All righty.
Michael: Which will be fine. I am off!
Andy: Have a good meeting!
Michael: Thank you! 
Andy:  Kick Wallace's ass!
Michael:  Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
Andy: I can't hear you through the glass
Michael:  Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
Andy: What?
Michael: All right. See you later.  Ahh.
Andy: Are you serious?
Michael: Yep. 


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1866]

David: So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Michael: Right what?
David: Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers.  Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Michael: David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1867]

Michael: Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1868]

Michael: This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1869]

David: Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
Michael:  Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
David: What say we do.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1870]

Michael: So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'
David: It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying.  And thanks for coming in.
Michael:  Oh, thank you.
David: Yes.
Michael: I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
David: Yeah.
Michael: Okay. 
David:  Yeah, finish up.


[Date: January 16, 2009, Session #1871]

Michael: Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1872]

Michael: What you talking bout, Wallace? 
David: Hi Michael how are you?
Michael: Hi, I am well, how are you?
David: So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
Michael: Oh, have you not?
David: Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
Michael: Yeah.
David: There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
Michael: Okay.
David: I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Michael: Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
David: Look, this is important, Michael.
Michael: Oh, well, then, email it to me.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1873]

Dwight:  What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
Michael: I will seduce her.
Dwight: No, I wanna seduce her.
Michael: No, I will seduce her.
Dwight: Please Michael, please.
Michael: No, I got it.
Dwight: You'll fall in love with her.
Michael: Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
Dwight: Okay, let's go over the plan again.
Michael: Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
Dwight: Your fictitious name?
Michael: Michael Scarn.
Dwight: I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Then we meet at the Denny's...
Michael:  No.
Dwight: ...and then we compare notes.
Michael: No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
Dwight: No! 
Dwight: You know how I feel about IHOP.
Michael: Oh, don't start,
Dwight: Are you socialist?
Michael: You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
Dwight: I'll have a cup of a coffee.
Michael: You will have pancakes and you'll like it.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1874]

Dwight: Store only has three employees.
Michael: So what?
Dwight: It means they are not expanding.
Michael: Maybe they are shrinking.
Dwight: No.
Michael: They could be shrinking.
Dwight: No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Michael: Ah ha  Yup.
Dwight:  Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Michael: Mm hmm .
Dwight: Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
Michael: And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
Dwight: Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Michael: Argh, why are you all...
Dwight: Get your clouds right.
Michael: Shut up.
Dwight: So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it.  No, no like this.  Good.
Michael: Ready to do this?
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: Good. Here come the sharks. 


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1875]

Michael: In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1876]

Michael: Hello.
Entire Prince family: Hello, hi.
Michael: My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
Prince Grandfather: Oh, please come in
Michael: Thank you.
Prince Grandfather: What kind of business are you in.
Michael: We are a law firm.
Prince Grandfather: I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office.
Michael: You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
Prince Grandfather: About 80.
Michael: Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
Prince Grandfather: It's just me, my wife and my son.
Michael: Ah, so when did you set up shop?
Prince Grandfather: I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.
Michael: Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .
Prince Grandfather:  Mmhmm. 


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1877]

Michael: So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
Prince Grandfather: You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.
Michael: Well that is... because... I am a genius.
Prince Grandfather: Oh really?
Michael: Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Is this the cup?  Is this what I drink out of?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
Dwight: Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Prince Grandfather: Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now.
Dwight: Why don't you just get rid of this guy? 
Prince Grandfather: That's my son.
Dwight: I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
Michael: Try 80.
Dwight: Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
Prince Grandfather: I sure hope not.
Dwight: Me too. 


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1878]

Prince: Grandfather: So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin?
Dwight: My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. 
Michael: Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
Dwight: It's going very well.
Michael: Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
Linda: You want a picture of me?
Michael: I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great  Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left 
Linda: Can I get a copy of that?
Prince Granddaughter: Grandma, I can't do this.
Michael: What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
Prince Granddaughter: Right.
Michael: Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
Prince Granddaughter: 8
Michael: Excellent! Way to go! Nice! 
Prince Grandmother: Don't put that. 


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1879]

Michael: Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.
Prince Grandfather: Wait; let me get something for you. Here is some, some references. Here is a list of references, our top clients. You call any of them; I trust you will hear some good things.
Michael: I... Okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you. 
Dwight:  Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Michael: Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
Dwight: Thank you very much.
Michael: I cannot wait to contact your clients.
Dwight: Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. 
Prince Grandfather: Bye bye now. So long.
Dwight and Michael: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. 
Michael: Haha, we struck the mother load!
Dwight: Cmon.
Michael: Wallace is going to freak.
Dwight: All their top clients I can't believe it.
Michael: He's going to absolutely freak.
Dwight: Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. 
Michael: Oh shoot.
Dwight: You drove over that. Go back 
Michael: Oh God, what was that?
Dwight: That's not good.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1880]

Dwight: Oh my God.
Michael: Aw, it's alright.
Dwight: Oh man,
Michael: Aw, my car.
Dwight: Not good.
Prince Grandfather: Is everyone okay?
Prince Grandmother: It sounded bad.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
Dwight: You've done more then you can possibly know.
Michael: Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
Prince Grandfather: A tow truck is going to charge you one hundred bucks to take you a mile.  Let me take a look.
Michael: No, no, really not necessary.
Dwight: He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
Prince Grandfather: I'll be right back I'm just going to grab my tool box.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1881]

Dwight: How much longer is this going to take?
Michael: You know let me give you some money for this.
Prince Son: No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands.
Michael: Oh coffee, that's too much. 
Dwight: This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Prince Grandfather: Well that outta do it. 
Prince Granddaughter: Its all better.
Michael: Thank you.
Prince Grandfather: Gosh, well so long. 
Dwight: I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Michael: Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
Dwight: Goodbye prince family,  should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it.  Bye bye.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1882]

Jim:  I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
Pam: No, because... 
Michael: Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
Dwight: Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Michael: Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
Dwight: They could do better.
Michael: Why don't we just, live and let live?
Dwight: What?
Michael: Live and let live.
Dwight: I'm not familiar with that expression,
Michael: It's from James Bond.
Dwight: It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
Michael: I'm not going to make this call.
Dwight: Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
Michael: My heart says...
Dwight: Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
Michael: That is true.
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: Jan... Ryan.
Dwight: Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1883]

Dwight: There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
Michael: You're right.
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Dwight: Good, so,  where are you going?
Michael: Just something I have to do first.
Dwight: Where are you taking the client list?
Michael: Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone 
Dwight: Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. 
Michael: Oh shoot! 
Dwight: Freeze, give me the list! 
Dwight: No no no, I can't let you do this!
Michael: Those people will be ruined. 
Dwight: Its business, not personal. 
Michael: Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
Dwight: Its over, Michael, its over. 
Michael: Im not a shark.


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1884]

David: This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Michael:  Mpfh.
David: Good work.
Michael: Thank you.
David: Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
Michael: Okay, bye bye.
Dwight: Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
Michael: I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?


[Date: January 22, 2009, Session #1885]

Michael: Oh, hey what is this?
Pam: Hillary swank.
Michael: Oh, she is hot. 

[Date: January 26, 2009, Session #1886]

Dwight:   Does anyone smell anything smoky?
Angela: Did you bring your jerky in again?
Dwight: 
Pam:  Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
Phyllis: What--
Andy: Whoa, fire!
Dwight: Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Pam: The phones are dead.
Dwight: Oh, how did that happen?
Kevin: It's out in the hall.
Dwight: No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Michael: Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.
Dwight: What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
Michael: Stay  calm!
Dwight: Wait, wait, wait.
Michael: Everyone, now  calm down!
Dwight: No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Michael: What does warm mean?
Everyone:  Oh my God.
Dwight: Not a viable option.
Pam: Try a different door.
Dwight: Okay, what's next?
Michael: Don't run.
Dwight: Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Andy: It-- it's warm.
Dwight: Well, uh, another option. 
Jim: Back door.
Dwight: Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Phyllis: Oh! I forgot my purse.
Stanley: Leave it woman!
Michael: Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
Dwight: Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
Oscar: Ah! My hand!  That's hot!
Andy: Aah! This ones hot too!
Michael: Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself.
Dwight: Okay, let's go.
Everyone:  Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!
Dwight: Calm, please
Andy: Get out of the way!
Dwight: Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Andy: Move it!
Dwight: Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
Angela:  It's okay.  Shh shhh.
Dwight: A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Angela: Oscar.
Dwight: What's next?
Angela: Oscar!
Oscar: Stay alive!  I'm getting help!
Angela: Pull me up!
Oscar: You're too heavy!
Angela: I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit!  Oh!
Dwight: How about 911?  Anyone? 911. 
Pam: What do we do?
Dwight: Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Jim: Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. 
Angela: What is that?  What is that?
Andy: The fire's shooting at us!
Phyllis: What in the name of God is going on?!
Andy: Yes!  Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
Phyllis and Creed: Ahhhh!!! 
Andy: Go, go, go, go, go!! 
Michael:  Help!! Help!!
Stanley: I'm about to die!
Dwight:  Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
Jim: What?!
Dwight: Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise.  So, what have we learned?   Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
Michael: No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
Jim: No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
Michael: He's going to swallow is tongue.
Jim: No. Michael. Michael.
Michael: Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.
Jim:  Michael! Michael!
Michael: Leave me al--
Andy: You're choking him!
Michael: Saving him!


[Date: January 26, 2009, Session #1887]

David Wallace: How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
Dwight: A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Michael: Electricity.
Dwight: Shampoo.
David Wallace: You could have burned down the whole building.
Dwight: I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
Lawyer: Did you shout, 'Fire!', causing a panic?
Dwight: Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Michael: Hed. Hedded
Dwight: When no one hedded--
Michael: Take hedded of.
Dwight: N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Michael: Heed. Heed.
Dwight: So, you--
Michael: Take heed of.
Dwight: And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
Michael: Take heed of.
Dwight: Hee-heeding this right now.
Lawyer: Wh--what?
Michael: Okay.  This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
David Wallace: No, we are mad.
Michael: Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
David Wallace: No, we're not.
Michael: I am not a mind reader, David.
David: Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Michel: Can you shove down?  Instead... shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.
Dwight: No.
Michael: And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like.
Dwight: PETA.
David Wallace: Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?
Michael: Do you?
David Wallace: Michael?
Michael: You talking to me?
David Wallace: Yeah.
Michael: What?


[Date: January 26, 2009, Session #1888]

Dwight: Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely.  It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
Michael:  No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
Dwight: Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
Michael: That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
Dwight: What? You?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Come on.
Michael: I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.
Dwight: That's preposterous.
Michael: No, I will.


[Date: January 27, 2009, Session #1889]

Michael: Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.


[Date: January 28, 2009, Session #1890]

Michael: Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable.  Welcome back, Stanley.
Stanley: Thank you, Michael.


[Date: January 28, 2009, Session #1891]

Michael: Andy.
Andy:  A throne for your highness.
Stanley: I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
Michael: No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.


[Date: January 28, 2009, Session #1892]

CPR trainer: A-B-C. Okay?  And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation.
Michael: Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'
Dwight: This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
Michael: Shut it.  Shut it.


[Date: January 28, 2009, Session #1893]

Michael: We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.


[Date: January 28, 2009, Session #1894]

Kevin:  I can't keep doing this forever.
CPR Trainer: It's been 20 seconds.
Kevin: Call it.
CPR Trainer: Would you like to try next?
Dwight: Absolutely I would not.
Michael: You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Stanley: Oh, I don't know.
Phyllis: That's not a good idea, Michael.
Michael: Come on.
Phyllis: He needs to rest.
Michael: No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
Stanley: I would die.
Michael: And you're okay with that?
Stanley: I'm okay with the logic of it.
Michael: Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.


[Date: January 28, 2009, Session #1895]

Michael: Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it!
Angela: Michael!
Michael: This is you we're talking about.
Angela: Michael.
Michael: Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go.  Stanley.  All right.
CPR Trainer: So, assessing the situation.  Are they breathing?
Michael: No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
Rose: No, that's not part of it.
Michael: Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
Kevin: I would want to live with no legs.
Michael: How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
Rose: All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute .
Michael: okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
Jim: How's that gonna help you?
Michael: I will divide and then count to it.
Jim: Right.
Rose: Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees.  Do you know that song?
Michael: Yes, yes I do.  I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Rose: No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Michael: Okay, I got it.
Creed:  You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
Michael: Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Michael: Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
Andy: Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay,  you can look the other way. Loo do do!
Rose: Okay!
Andy: Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Rose: Okay!
Everyone:  Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Rose: Yeah, okay.  You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
Dwight: Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
Rose: I have no idea.
Dwight: Anyone else?
Phyllis: We bury him?
Dwight: Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
Creed: He has no wallet, I checked.
Michael: He is an organ donor.
Dwight: He is.
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.  Here we go.
Angela: Oh my God! Dwight!
Kelly: Dwight!
Angela: What are you--  What are you doing?
Dwight: We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
Stanley: I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down.
Michael: Hey, Stanley.
Andy: Stanley.
Michael: Are you okay?
Angela: Oh my God! 
Stanley: Oh my God!
Angela: Dwight!
Dwight: Clarice?
Stanley: Oh my God!


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1896]

David Wallace: Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
Dwight: I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
David Wallace: We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
Michael: Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
Dwight: Wow.
Michael: Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1897]

Michael: Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
Dwight: I have.
Michael: Let's hear it.
Dwight:  'I state my regret.'
Jim: You couldn't of memorized that?
Dwight: I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
Phyllis: It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Dwight: Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1898]

Michael:  Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me.  Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1899]

Michael: My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.  That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1900]

Michael:  It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
Jim: Don't open your eyes.
Pam: What?  Oh...
Michael: And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
Meredith: Chunky monkey.
Michael: Too expensive.
Stanley: Chocolate.
Michael: Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
Stanley: It's my bio-feedback machine..
Michael: Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
Stanley: It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
Michael: You have stress?
Stanley: Yes...
Michael: During our relaxation exercise?
Phyllis: Let me get you some water.
Michael: No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
Stanley: No, Michael, No. 
Michael: Let me getcha.
Stanley: Would ya, would ya step back please
Michael: Ok, alright.
Stanley: Please. A little further.
Michael: Ok. 
Stanley: That's better. 
Michael: Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay?  Let's give this a shot.
Michael: Hellloo... 
Kevin: Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1901]

Michael: So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1902]

Michael: I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
Dwight: Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Michael: Oh...
Dwight: Speaking of which... 
Michael: Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1903]

Michael: Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
Kelly: A vacation.
Michael: What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...
Oscar: Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
Michael: Si senor.
Oscar: That's offensive.
Michael: It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1904]

Michael: I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1905]

Dwight: May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Phyllis: Hey, this is your apology letter.
Dwight: That was the last signature I needed.
Michael: Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
Angela: If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. 


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1906]

Angela: If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
Group: Michael Scott! 
Michael: Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1907]

Kelly: I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
Michael: You're so lucky! Good one... 


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1908]

Meredith: Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Michael: Well...
Meredith: Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
Michael: Pow pow pow... 


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1909]

Michael:  NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. 


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1910]

Jim: Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
Michael: I know where this is goin'.
Jim: Do ya?
Michael: No...
Jim: Ok. Remember Spider face?
Michael: No.
Jim: OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Michael: Spite her - ok 
Jim: Yeah... yep.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1911]

Dwight: How dare you all attack him like this.
Michael: Oh, stop it Dwight.
Dwight: Michael is your superior.
Michael: No no no no no no!
Dwight: Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Michael: Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
Dwight: Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
Michael: That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
Dwight: You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
Michael: Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
Dwight: Are you calling me an idiot?
Michael: Idiot.
Dwight: Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. 


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1912]

Pam: Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.  He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
Michael: Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
Pam: Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.  If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! 
Michael: Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1913]

Darryl: Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
Michael: We are, we are a family.
Darryl: Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
Michael: Oh very funny.
Darryl: What's his name?
Michael: Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
Darryl: Roy left years ago. What's his name?
Michael: I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Warehouse Michael: Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic...
Darryl: What's
Michael: Jefferson.
Darryl: Nope. His name is Michael. 


[Date: January 29, 2009, Session #1914]

Andy:  What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
Michael: Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.  Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.  So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought  sorry.  I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...  I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... 


[Date: January 30, 2009, Session #1915]

Michael:  Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...


[Date: January 30, 2009, Session #1916]

Michael: You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.  I'm okay. No, I'm not.


[Date: January 30, 2009, Session #1917]

Pam: Michael! It's really good to see you.
Dwight: Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Jim: Are you alright?
Oscar: Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. 
Michael: I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
Pam: What?
Michael: Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela?  Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are...  Oscar, you're gay.
Oscar: Wow.
Michael: Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.  Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. 


[Date: January 30, 2009, Session #1918]

Michael: They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.

[Date: February 5, 2009, Session #1919]

Michael: 


[Date: February 5, 2009, Session #1920]

Jim: This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
Michael:  This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.  I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.  Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
Jim: 
Michael: Could I stick it with a pin?
Pam: Ugh.
Michael:  Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
Jim: 
Michael: You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
Jim: That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Michael: What?
Jim: What the heck? Is that, uh... 
Michael: You find it?
Jim: I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
Michael: All right.
Jim: All right.
Michael: Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1921]

Michael:  Hello, good morning.
Pam: Good morning.
Michael: You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1922]

Michael: Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.  No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.  Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
Pam: He brought a sled.
Michael: No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
Pam: Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
Michael: Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Pam: Separate rooms.
Michael: Well that goes without saying.
Pam: I'm going to say it anyway.
Michael: Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant?  That's...
Pam: This is a new cardigan.
Michael: ...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
Pam: No.
Michael: No. Oh, all right.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1923]

Pam: Can I turn on the radio?
Michael: No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
Pam: But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
Michael: Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
Pam: That's dangerous.
Michael: Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
Pam: That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
Michael: You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
Pam: No, that was a long time ago.
Michael: Is that why your wearing makeup today?
Pam: No, I'm not even wearing that much.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1924]

Michael: Hello, Rolando, how are you?
Rolando: Hi.
Michael: Rolando,  I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
Rolando:  Uh, your late, everyone's already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over.
Michael: Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
Pam: Stop it, please.
Michael: That's what I do, steal my trick.
Pam: Please cut it out.
Karen: Hey. Hi, guys.
Michael:  Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
Karen: What!
Pam: Michael!
Karen: Of course not!
Michael: Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
Karen: Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Michael: Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1925]

Michael:  NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you...  This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't.  Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
Karen: Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Michael: I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
Karen: But now we think you're a liar.
Michael: Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? 


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1926]

Michael: I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1927]

Michael: I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. 'M' your name is Mark.
Mark: Yes.
Michael: Got it. It works.
Karen: Uh, it's very insulting.
Michael: But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
Mark: But we already know each other's names.
Michael: Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
Karen: Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
Michael: Oh, I still have more.
Karen: Can I please see you in my office, please?
Michael: She is pregnant. She is knocked up. 'K' Karen. Pam, let's go.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1928]

Michael: I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, 'Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.'
Karen: No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
Michael: No, don't worry, the chain is off.
Pam: No it's not.
Karen: You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Michael: Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
Pam: So when are you due?
Karen: Uh, in about a month.
Pam: Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
Karen: Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
Michael: It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
Karen: Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
Michael: Oh, great.
Karen: His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Pam: Oh, he's cute.
Karen: Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
Pam: What is happening there? 
Karen: Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
Pam: It's really sweet.
Michael: No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
Karen: So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
Pam: Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
Karen: That's so great. That's great.
Pam: Thank you.
Karen: Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. 
Michael: Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1929]

Michael: I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
Pam: I like her.
Michael: Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Pam: I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
Michael: Why?
Pam: Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1930]

Pam: Are you asleep?
Michael: No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Pam: No, remind me.
Michael: Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
Pam: Perfect boobs,  of course I remember Holly.
Michael: She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
Pam: Okay, lets go.
Michael:  I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
Pam: Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this.
Michael:  Okay.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1931]

Michael: I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1932]

Michael: I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1933]

Michael:  And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1934]

Michael: You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
Pam: ... Okay, let's go.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1935]

Michael: Do I look okay?
Pam: You look good.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1936]

Michael: Hi.
Receptionist: Hi, can I help you?
Michael: Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
Receptionist: Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat.
Michael: Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
Receptionist: Actually, she's on an HR retreat for the next three days.
Michael: Oh- She's not here?
Receptionist: But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. He's a salesman here.
Michael: A.J.
Receptionist: Yeah, he's her boyfriend. He's just over there.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1937]

Michael: She has a boyfriend.
Pam: I'm so sorry, Michael.
Michael: How could she do this to me, Pam?
Pam: She's not doing it to hurt you.
Michael: I can't do the presentation, I can't-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! 
Pam: Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
Michael: I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? 
Pam: You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
Michael: And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
Pam: Yeah, maybe.
Michael: 
Pam: Maybe. One step at a time.
Michael: 
Pam: You can do this.
Michael: I can do this.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1938]

Michael: Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen.  Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?
A.J.: A.J.
Michael: A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
A.J.: 
Michael: What do you race cars?
A.J.:  I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.
Michael: Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
A.J.: Yeah. Why, are you interested? 
Woman: I have a question about discounts from distributors.
Michael: Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
A.J.: It's pretty serious, yes.
Michael: Huh-  Does she ever talk about me? 
Pam: Oh, God.
A.J.: Excuse me?
Man: What does this have to do with sales?
Michael: It's all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
A.J.: No, what are you talking about?
Michael:  Does it feel good?
A.J.: Does what feel good?
Michael:  Your life.  Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue.  Oh, wow.  Ooh, okay.
Pam: Michael, get off the floor!
Michael: Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
Pam:  No, no, no, you have to do it-
Michael: No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.  Okay... okay.
Pam: That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.  I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.   Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1939]

Michael: 


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1940]

Michael: Want some pie?
Pam: No.
Michael: I went through Holly's things.
Pam: What?
Michael: I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
Pam: Oh, Michael...
Michael: I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.'
Pam: You did what?
Michael: I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
Pam: She never sent it to you?
Michael: No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
Pam: No.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
Michael: How?
Pam: Because, she didn't send it to you!
Michael: I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
Pam: I could read it.
Michael: No, that wouldn't-
Pam: Yeah, I could read it.
Michael: No, you don't have to do that.
Pam: Go get your laptop.
Michael: Okay. 
Pam:  What? I'm not in love with her.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1941]

Pam:  It's deleted.
Michael: Well?
Pam: She still has feelings for you.
Michael: She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
Pam: I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
Michael: You're sure?
Pam: 
Michael:  Okay.


[Date: February 6, 2009, Session #1942]

Michael: I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
Pam: No, we don't need to do that.
Michael: Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
Pam: You mean Tony?
Michael: Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
Pam: Oh, Michael.
Michael: Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.


[Date: February 13, 2009, Session #1943]

Phone Salesman: How about I make an appointment to come back?  That way, I know he'll be here.
Pam: That is a great idea.
Phone Salesman: Great.
Pam:  Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
Jim:  Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Pam: There he is!
Phone Salesman: Oh, hi! Great.
Jim: Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Michael:  Hello, may I help you?
Jim: Jimbo!
Michael: ...Jim.
Jim:   Ayyyy!

Pam: Ayyyy!
Michael: Ayyyy!
Jim: Ayyyy!
Dwight:  Ayyyy!
Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight: Ayyyy!
Phone Salesman: Ok.  I'm, uh, I'll be going.
Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight: Ayyyy!
Michael:  What was that?
Pam: That was funny.
Michael: That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1944]

Michael: Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Kevin: I miss Stacy.
Michael: Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...
Kevin: I can't even imagine.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1945]

Michael: Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.    They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1946]

Michael: Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1947]

Michael: Pam, really, they're back?
Pam: I can't see them when they're on the floor
Jim: They're for her to look at, Michael.
Michael: Can I have a word with you, Jim?
Jim: Yes, let's have a word.
Michael: Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Jim: Oh, I'm sorry.
Michael: Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Jim: I understand that.
Dwight: So sexy it becomes hostile.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Michael: Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
Jim: We do.
Michael: --that none of us can be a part of--
Pam: You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
Michael:  --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
Jim: That sounds fun.
Michael: So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
Dwight: Yeah, deal with it Pam!
Michael: So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1948]

Michael: I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
Blood Drive Worker: You're gonna need to lie down right over here.
Michael: Okay.  Hello.
Blood Girl: Hi, I cant talk right now.  I'm sorry.
Michael: Oh, OK.
Blood Girl: Whew, I'm really nervous.
Michael: Yeah, me too.
Blood Girl: Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.
Michael: Oh, well, that's fine.
Blood Girl: Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah.
Michael: Yeah, can I point something out to you?
Blood Girl: Sure.
Michael: You're actually talking a lot.
Blood Girl: Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous.
Michael: Okay, here we go.
Blood Drive Worker: Alright, here we go.
Michael: Oh, God. 
Blood Drive Worker: Just relax.
Michael: Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch.
Blood Girl: Oh, that's gross.
Michael: Type O-Ocean Spray.
Blood Girl: God, stop.  Stop it.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1949]

Michael: Yick.
Blood Girl: What?
Michael: I looked at the bag.
Blood Girl: Ew.
Michael: I looked straight at the bag.
Blood Girl: That's not good.
Michael: Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
Blood Girl: Well, ok... bags!  Alright, that was bad.
Michael: That was mean.
Blood Girl: Um, a hat.
Michael: A hat.
Blood Girl: A hat with no blood in it?
Michael: That is full of soup.
Blood Girl: You're cute.
Michael: What?
Blood Drive Worker: You're done.
Michael: Oh, already.
Blood Girl: Ah, we did it!
Michael: Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. 
Blood Girl: Is he OK?


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1950]

Michael:  Oh my God, how long was I out?  
Hank: What?
Michael: Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
Blood Drive Worker: Oh.  She left.
Michael: OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Blood Drive Worker: I'm sorry sir we can't give out that information. 


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1951]

Michael: Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us.  Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
Kelly: Well, his heart was in the right place.
Michael: Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.   Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.
Oscar: I don't think so.
Michael: Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
Oscar: I can't.
Michael: If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1952]

Oscar: Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Angela: Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Oscar: I was stupid, I told him.
Kevin: Was he in to you in like a gay way?
Michael: Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
Oscar: He told me he wasn't gay. 
Michael: Really sad.
Oscar: I'm not done yet.
Michael: Oh my God.
Kevin: A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' 
Michael: Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Angela: My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Oscar: Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Angela: No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Oscar: Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Angela: I guess I have.  Huh.
Michael: Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?
Oscar: He's on one of his honeymoons.
Michael: What?
Oscar: He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Kevin: My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Michael: You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
Dwight: You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Michael: No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
Dwight: A net? a giant net?
Michael: No.  Not a giant net.
Dwight: What do you have in mind?
Michael: I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
Dwight: Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
Michael: Old fashioned meet market --
Dwight: No.
Michael: -- I don't think it is.
Dwight: Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1953]

Michael: These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1954]

Michael: Hey.
Dwight: Hey.  No movement.
Michael: Ah, still early.
Dwight: Eh, its not that early.
Michael:  So how you holding up?
Dwight: I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Michael: No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Dwight: Oh.  Meh.
Michael: Meh, exactly.  Eh.
Dwight: Eh.
Michael: Oh, here we go.
Dwight: Hello.
Michael: Hello. 
Dwight: Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend?   Hi, Dwight.
Michael: Babe alert!   Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Lynn: Oh, hi! I'm Lynn.
Michael: Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Kevin: Hello.
Lynn: Hi.
Michael:  So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.   Where you from?
Kevin: I'm from here!
Michael: Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
Kevin: Thank you, Michael.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1955]

Michael: So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Eric: I am.
Michael: Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1956]

Michael: It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.  Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so  it's not too late.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1957]

Dwight: ...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Michael: No reason.
Dwight: Is somebody after you?
Oscar: Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Dwight: Hey, it just takes one!
Michael: Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
Kelly: You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Michael: It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Kelly: Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
Meredith: She could be your soul mate.
Dwight: Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
Oscar: It's possible.
Kelly: She could be.
Michael: Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
Kelly: Aww. 


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1958]

Girl: Is this the party? 
Michael: Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1959]

Dwight: So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Blonde: OK. 
Dwight: OK, what's up?
Blonde: Look, I'm gonna go...
Dwight: Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Blonde: Look, we already have a paper supplier.
Dwight: OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Michael: Hey, you don't deserve her.
Dwight: Thanks, Michael.


[Date: February 14, 2009, Session #1960]

Michael: Hey, if anybody wants to go...
Oscar: We can stay a little longer.
Michael: Really?   Oh, thanks.
Kelly: Michael, it's time.
Michael: You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
Oscar: Come on, we'll all go.
Michael:  OK.


[Date: February 15, 2009, Session #1961]

Michael: Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.


[Date: March 12, 2009, Session #1962]

Pam:  Yeah, that's no problem.
Michael: Pam?
Pam:  Sure. Uh huh.
Michael: Pam? Knock, knock.
Pam: I'm on the phone.
Michael: I know you are. Knock, knock.
Pam:  You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Michael:  4-9-1-7-4-5-1
Pam: 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye.  It really makes us look unprofessional.
Michael: They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. 
Pam:  Who's there?
Michael: Buddha.
Pam: Buddha who?
Michael:  Buddha this bread for me, won't you? 
Pam: Great.
Michael: I, I need something to wipe my hand.
Pam: Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
Michael: That was helping. It was classic.
Dwight: I got a knock-knock joke.
Michael: No... God.
Dwight: OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
Michael: Alright.
Dwight:  Knock, knock.
Michael: Who's there?
Dwight: KGB.
Michael: KGB - 
Dwight:  We will ask the questions!
Michael: What the hell was that? 
Dwight: What are you doing?
Michael: What are you doing?
Dwight: Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
Michael: You, you like that?
Dwight: C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Michael: Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
Jim: Ding Dong.
Michael:  Who's there?
Jim: KGB.
Michael: Dwight, get the door.
Dwight: I'm not answering it.
Michael: Answer the door.
Jim: Ding dong.
Dwight: No way, it's the KGB.
Jim: Ding dong.
Dwight: I'm not answering that. You answer it.
Michael: I'm not gonna answer it
Dwight: I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. 
Jim: The KGB will wait for no one! 
Dwight: It's true.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1963]

Pam:  Good morning, Michael.
Michael: Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
Pam: Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Michael: Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
Pam: Jelly beans.
Michael: No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1964]

Michael: The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1965]

Michael: I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.  Umm hmm.
Jim: We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Michael: Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
Jim: Free paper.'
Michael: No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
Andy: Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Michael: No, you don't. No, it -  What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1966]

Jim:  Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket.  One of my clients found a golden ticket.   Yup. No, congratulations. 
Michael: Woo hoo.
Jim:  I'll take that down right now.
Michael: Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
Jim: I'm on the phone.
Michael: ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
Jim:  Hold on one second.
Michael: Invite them on the tour.
Jim:  It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Michael: Really? That's kind of a big client.  Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
Oscar: Ten percent?
Michael: Yeah?
Oscar: They're our largest client.
Michael: Yeah.
Oscar: It's gonna hurt.
Jim:  Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1967]

Jim: How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Michael: I thought I did. So...
Jim: OK...
Michael: Well no harm no foul.
Jim: ...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Michael: You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1968]

Michael: Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Darryl: Start over.
Michael: Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
Darryl: Were the boxes near each other?
Michael: Irrelevant.
Darryl: I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Michael: OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1969]

Michael: My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.  That... 


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1970]

Michael: Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
Oscar: They can.
Michael: No, they can't.
Oscar: Yes, they can.
Michael: Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
Oscar: Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Michael: Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
Jim: So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Michael: Thank you, Jim is with me.
Jim: Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
Michael: Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
Creed: That's not why.
Michael: OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes.
Pam: Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? 
Jim: Good one.
Michael: OK, don't get that. Please? 
Stanley: I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Michael: That is not constructive.
Pam:  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1971]

Michael:  Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
David:  Michael, what the hell is going on here?
Michael: How are you doing?
David: Fine. What is going on?
Michael:  My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
David: Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
Michael: Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
David: How could you not know Michael?
Michael: I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
David: Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
Michael: You're breaking up.
David: Michael?
Michael: OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
David: Was it the sales department?
Michael: Yes.
David: Was it Jim?
Michael: No.
David: OK, was it Dwight?
Michael:  Yes.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1972]

Michael:  Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
Dwight: That was your idea.
Michael: Woah, wow, who told you that?
Dwight: You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Michael:  No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
Dwight:  You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Michael: I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
Dwight: Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Michael: Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Dwight: You don't keep a diary.
Michael: Yes I do. You've just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Dwight: Hold that thought.   March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Michael: Why do you have a diary?
Dwight: To keep secrets from my computer.
Michael: OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
Dwight: Impossible.
Michael: Yes, you did.
Dwight: I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Michael: What are you writing? 
Dwight: Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Michael: Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
Dwight: With all my heart.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1973]

Michael: We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
Dwight: OK, what am I thinking right now?
Michael: Umm, nacho chips.
Dwight: No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Michael: Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
Dwight: Oh, not gonna happen.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1974]

Michael: Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
Dwight: What about Shoe La La?
Michael:  It's not ready yet.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1975]

Michael: I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1976]

Michael: May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Oscar: These aren't announcements.
Michael: Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1977]

Dwight: I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Michael: He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
Dwight: Well...
Michael: I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
Dwight: We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Michael: Right.
Dwight: No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Michael: That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
Dwight: Try me.
Michael: That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
Dwight: I haven't made a decision yet.
Michael: You kind of have.
Dwight: No.
Michael: Yes.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1978]

Michael:  Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do?  What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight?  Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
David: That's too bad.
Michael: Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
David: Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. 
Dwight: David... you're welcome. 


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1979]

David: I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? 
David: Alright Dwight. This is huge.
Dwight: That's what she said! 
Michael: Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
Dwight: Inspiration.
Michael: Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
Dwight:  You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Michael: Give me the details of how that happened.
Jim: You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Michael: What?
Jim: And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Dwight: Apology rejected.
Pam:  Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
Dwight: Oh Pam.
Creed: Good work, kid.
Dwight: Thanks old man.
David: This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Dwight: Yeah.
David: Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
Pam: Sure.
Michael: David? David?
Dwight:  'Cause I've got this idea...
Michael: David?
David: Yeah?
Michael: Could I be a part of the meeting also?
David: You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Jim: Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. 
Dwight: Alright.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1980]

David:  Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
Dwight: OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
Man on phone: Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there?  I hear panting.
David: No. No dogs.
Dwight: So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea .
Michael: There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Pam: It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Dwight: Pam...
Michael: I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Dwight: That is my idea.
David:  We are gonna call you back guys.  What is going on here?
Michael: OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
David: No, no.
Dwight: It is my idea.
Michael: Oh how dare you.
Dwight: It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
Michael: You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
Dwight: Horse Boat.
Michael: Oh please.
Dwight: A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Michael: Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
Dwight: Oh give me a break.
Michael: ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
Dwight: That's because they're easy!
Michael: They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Dwight:  Women's urinals... uh...
David:  Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
Dwight: Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Michael: Thank You!
David: What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
Michael: Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
David: OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
Pam: OK.
David: I am gone.


[Date: March 13, 2009, Session #1981]

Michael: When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
Dwight: Oh I am. In my own words.
Michael: I want to see it.
Dwight: No.
Michael: I want to see it. 
Dwight: No, Michael.
Michael: Give me...  Give me the diary.
Dwight: No! 


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1982]

Dwight: Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
Michael: I like it.
Dwight: Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Jim:  I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Dwight: Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Jim: I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Michael: I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
Jim: And of course, classy.
Michael: And classy, yeah.
Dwight: Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1983]

Dwight: Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. 
Michael:  You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Jim: That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Mr. Peanut is not classy.
Michael: He is.
Dwight: He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Michael: That's what makes him classy.
Dwight: Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Jim: Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
Dwight: Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
Jim: Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Michael: Strawberries?
Jim: That's inspired.
Dwight: I said that! 
Pam: Not classy.
Michael: Not classy at all.
Jim: De class'.
Michael: French. Classy.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1984]

Pam: Hi, can I help you?
Charles: Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Pam: Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Michael:  Yes?
Pam: Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Michael: Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Pam: Yeah, are you coming out now?
Michael: Uh-huh.  Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.  At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.  Here he is.
Charles: I-I was-
Michael: Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Michael: What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
Jim: Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Michael: You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1985]

Dwight: Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Michael: Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Dwight: We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1986]

Michael: Surprise!  As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
Charles: Thank you.
Michael: Took me all night.
Pam: This is what you did last night?


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1987]

Michael: I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do.  It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1988]

Michael: All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
Charles: Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Michael: Oh, nerd alert!
Kevin: Ni-
Michael: This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
Charles: Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
Michael: This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange 
Andy: Hey-o!
Michael: There you go! Where's the other?
Charles: You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
Michael: Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
Kevin: Hey!
Charles: How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Michael: Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. 
Charles: Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
Michael: Oh! Well...
Charles: That's great.
Michael: Above and beyond.
Charles: Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
Michael: That's true.
Charles: But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Stanley:  Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Michael: No. Absolutely not.
Charles: Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Oscar: Do you have specifics?
Charles: Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
Michael: Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
Charles: You didn't tell them.
Michael: Well, why don't-
Charles: Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Michael: Charles is going to tell you.
Charles: Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
Stanley: Fantastic.
Michael: Well, it's not official.
Charles: It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
Michael: Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Charles: No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Michael: Well-
Dwight: What about your party?
Michael: Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Charles: Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
Michael: Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
Charles: No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1989]

Michael: I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1990]

Michael:  David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
David: What gave you that idea?
Michael: It was my understanding.
David: I see.
Michael: Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
David: Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
Michael: But the branch is still mine?
David: You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
Dwight: Ask him about the party.
Michael: Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
David: I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
Dwight: No the other thing.
Michael: Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? 
Dwight: He hung up?
David: No.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1991]

Michael: I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
Charles: No.
Michael: Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Charles: Saticoy Steel.
Michael: Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
Charles: No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
Michael: You're not from paper?
Charles: No.
Michael: Does David know this?
Charles: Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Michael: Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
Charles: And what is that?
Michael: And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
Charles: That's not how I plan on doing things.
Michael: Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Charles: I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Michael: Whatever David wants.
Charles: Ok.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1992]

Michael:  Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
Dwight: Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. 
Stephanie: David Wallace's office.
Dwight: Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Stephanie: Good. Thank you.
Dwight: How's it hanging?
Stephanie: Alright. . .
Dwight: Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Michael: No! You idiot!  Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  
Stephanie: David Wallace's office.
Michael: Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
Stephanie: Michael...
Michael: And I really really need to talk to David.
Stephanie: Please hold.
Charles:  Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Michael: I was never given a name. 


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1993]

Pam:  Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Charles: Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
Angela: That is so unnecessary!
Michael: Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
Charles: It's no big deal.
Michael: I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Charles: You still have that option. 
Angela: Thanks again, Charles.
Kelly: Thank you.
Michael: Nobody thanked me.
Jim: Thanks, Charles.
Michael: For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
Charles: I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1994]

Michael:  Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1995]

Kevin: Michael?
Michael: Yep.
Kevin: I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Michael: Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Charles: Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Kevin: Ok.
Charles: Ok.
Michael: Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Charles: That's not the way it's gonna work.
Michael: Yes it is!
Charles: No, it is not.
Michael: No, it is not.
Charles: Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Michael: Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Charles: Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Michael: Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Charles: No, seriously.
Michael: No, seriously.
Charles: How old are you?
Michael: How old are you?
Pam: Oh no.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1996]

Charles: Five years old?
Michael: Five years old?
Andy: Duuudes, stop.
Employees:  Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. You're going to get all of us in trouble.
Charles: I will walk away.
Michael: I'm gonna walk away.
Andy: Stop doing that!
Michael: I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1997]

Pam: And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Michael: What is that smaller stripper holding?
Pam: Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Michael: Ok.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1998]

Charles: Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
Michael: Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Charles: This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Michael: Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
Jim: No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
Charles: Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
Jim: You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Michael: It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
Pam: It's really just a regular shaped cake.
Michael: But it's cool, and it's-
Charles: This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
Michael: Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Charles: Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Michael: Yeah, why don't you do that?
Charles:  Thank you very much.
Michael: Yeah, here we go. Ok.
Charles: Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Michael: What?
Charles: Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Michael: Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Charles: I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
Michael: Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. 


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #1999]

Michael: Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? 


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #2000]

David:  Michael.
Michael:  So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
David: How did you get here, Michael?
Michael: I drove.
David: Ok.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #2001]

Michael: Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
David: Michael. Listen-
Michael: Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
David: Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
Michael: Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
David: That's not exactly-
Michael: Clearly that's what you wanted.
David: No.
Michael: Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
David: Yes.
Michael: I've put having a family on hold.
David: We didn't ask you to do that.
Michael: And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.


[Date: March 19, 2009, Session #2002]

Michael: I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
David: Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
Michael: Ok.
David: We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
Michael:  I quit.
David: What?
Michael: You have no idea how high I can fly.


[Date: March 26, 2009, Session #2003]

Michael: I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left.
Kelly: Michael get to the good part.
Michael: Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
Oscar: At least he is in the building.
Michael: No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
Everyone: 


[Date: March 26, 2009, Session #2004]

Pam: Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Michael: I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.'
Stanley: Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Michael: Why would I do that?
Angela: Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
Kevin: That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Meredith: Did you spit in his face?
Michael: You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2005]

Kevin: Michael is that scotch?
Michael: Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2006]

Michael:  What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2007]

Stanley: Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Michael: I have a job.
Andy: For four more days.
Pam: Do you have any leads on a job?
Michael: Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
Jim: You called any headhunters?
Michael: Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Dwight: Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Jim: Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Charles: Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Michael: You're 'I need you to' is my command.
Charles: Okay.


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2008]

Andy: Hey Michael...
Michael: Hey.
Andy: Can I talk to you a minute?
Michael: You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.  Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
Andy: I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?    What's that?
Michael: Oh! Hey. What is this about?
Andy: Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
Michael: Oh.
Andy: I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Michael: Me too, me too. Is this wine?
Andy: Ah... busted. Yes
Michael: I already have wine.
Andy: Oh.

Michael: You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. 
Phone: Hi, you've reached Prince Paper.  We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business.  Thank you for your support. May God bless you.  Bye!
Michael:  What am I gong to do?  Uh... .

Michael: Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
Jim: I would prefer not to.
Michael: Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
Jim: You're starting your own paper company?
Michael: yeah!
Jim: Why?
Michael: Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
Jim: Do you know the industry is in decline?
Michael: Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
Jim: Right.
Michael: Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
Jim: No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Michael: Close them.
Jim: Okay. 
Michael: Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
Jim: I am not gonna do this.
Michael: Obviously.
Jim: And you are not going to, either.
Michael: Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Jim: Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Michael: Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
Charles: Jim.
Jim: Hey.
Charles: what are you doing?
Jim: Nothing, just talking.
Charles: Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Jim: I didn't... no.
Charles: Okay.  After you.
Michael: No I'm staying.
Charles: Okay.


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2015]

Michael: Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
Pam: Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Michael: You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
Pam: Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Michael: This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Pam: Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Michael: Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that?
Pam: Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Michael: Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Pam: Yeah. Good.
Michael: Thank you very much.
Pam: Mmm-hmm


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2016]

Michael: I'm starting my own paper company.
Andy: No way!?
Michael: Yeah.
Andy: In this climate?
Michael: Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Andy: Ehh...  well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Dwight: Your own paper company.
Michael: Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
Dwight: Right...
Michael: Potential, lots of potential. yes.
Dwight: What a courageous venture.
Michael: It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
Dwight: Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Michael: That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
Dwight: Okay. So yeah.
Michael: So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
Dwight: You know, I would love to put a pin in that.


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2017]

Oscar: You put a note in my food?
Michael: I made it sterile.
Oscar: Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Michael: I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
Oscar: Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Michael: No, no no.
Oscar: You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Michael: Okay.
Oscar: Five years?
Michael: Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.
Oscar: It's just not prudent Michael.

Stanley: No.
Michael: Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
Stanley: No I didn't.

Charles: Hey Hank, You ready?
Hank: Yeah.
Charles: Okay, Michael?
Michael: Hmm?
Charles: I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
Michael: Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
Charles: not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
Hank: Okay Michael.
Michael: Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
Hank: Come on man, let's, let's go.

Michael:  Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
Andy:  What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Kevin: I think he's singing.
Oscar: I can't believe this is really happening.
Michael: ... and I feel free!


[Date: March 27, 2009, Session #2023]

Michael: Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
Angela: These are for employees only.
Michael: Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
Kevin: Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
Michael: I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
Kevin: But you didn't want to start with us?
Michael: No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
Jim: I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Michael: So which way are you leaning?
Jim: Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Michael: Thanks Jim.
Charles: Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Dwight: No.
Charles: Okay, let me know if you find it.
Michael: Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?   Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.

Charles: Michael get up!
Michael: Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
Charles: Michael, what are you doing?
Michael: I think maybe Hank should be here.
Charles: Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
Michael: You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose.  Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.
Pam: Oh no.
Jim: What?
Pam: I'm going with him.
Jim: What? Pam!
Pam: I'm going.
Jim: Pam! You can't be serious.
Pam: Michael, wait!  I'm coming with you.
Michael: You are?
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Okay.  It's going to be great.
Pam: Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Michael: Right... Executive assistant.
Pam: Salesman.
Michael: Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
Jim: Still no.
Michael: Well, okay, lets go.
Pam: Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Michael: Are people watching?
Pam: Probably.
Jim: Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Michael: Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.

Michael: All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. 
Dwight: From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.


[Date: June 30, 2008, Session #2025]

Michael: This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.

Jim:   Really, nothing?
Darryl: 2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.

Pam: Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
Holly: Math is hard.
Kevin: Yeah.
Pam: Just, we'll just keep going.


[Date: July 7, 2008, Session #2028]

Michael: Jimbo.
Jim: Ah, they moved the shower.
Michael: Did you see Holly's butt?
Jim: No, I didn't.  You know why?
Michael: Why?
Jim: Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
Michael: I know.
Jim: But what have you learned about her?
Michael: I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read 'Lonesome Dove' three times.
Jim: Nice.
Michael: And that her butt refuses to quit!
Jim: Well, I tried. 
Michael:  You have to agree with me.  That's insane.
Jim: I'll just go later.
Michael: I thought you had to pee.


[Date: July 7, 2008, Session #2029]

Michael:  Hey, hey!  Pam, Pam! Hey!
Jim: What happened?
Michael:  I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
Pam: I should really get going.
Michael: No. OK. Um, the last word is 'seagulls.'
Pam: I'm sure it was really lovely.
Michael: I took a lot from other poems.
Jim: Call me when you get in. 
Pam: OK, bye.
Jim: Bye.
Michael: All right, call-- 
Pam: No, Michael.


[Date: July 7, 2008, Session #2030]

Michael: OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
Angela: It doesn't matter, Michael.
Michael: Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
Holly: Oh, fancy meeting you here.
Michael: All right.
Darryl: OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
Michael: All right!


[Date: July 7, 2008, Session #2031]

Michael:  I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
Holly: Wikka wikka wikka what?


[Date: July 14, 2008, Session #2032]

Michael: Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't.  Come on. Let's go in.


[Date: July 14, 2008, Session #2033]

Jim: All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications--
Pam:  I can see you!
Jim: All right!
Pam: This is so cool.
Jim: So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Pam: Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Jim: Uh-huh.
Pam: Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
Dwight: OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
Michael: No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
Pam: Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
Michael: Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
Pam: The nerve.
Michael: Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
Pam: They're on the supply shelf.
Michael: Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.


[Date: July 14, 2008, Session #2034]

Michael: OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
Darryl: 2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
Michael: Damn it. Come on.
Oscar:  Oh!
Kevin: Oh, my God!


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2035]

Dwight: Come on, Bernard. 
Michael: Here we go. Everybody on.
Dwight: All right, we're set.
Darryl: Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
Kelly: I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2036]

Michael: How's it going?
Phyllis: It's going well.
Michael: Good.
Holly: I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
Michael: Cake? Who suggested cake? 
Phyllis: We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Michael: Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2037]

Michael: What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2038]

Michael: Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Dwight: Shotgun weddings.
Jim: That's not what that is.
Creed: Fright. Being scared to death.
Michael: No.
Holly: Obesity-caused illnesses.
Dwight: Obesity-caused illnesses.
Michael: Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
Jim: I would like to lose 65 pounds.
Michael: Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
Angela: No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Michael: If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
Jim: Cryogenics. Beer me five.
Michael: This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2039]

Jim: All right, I'm taking off.
Michael: Booty call.
Jim: Nope, just going to see Pam.
Michael: Here.
Jim: Maybe put up some shelves.
Michael: Wait a second.  I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
Jim: OK, thank you for ... this.
Michael: You want more?
Jim: No.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2040]

Michael:  It's a pretty lame party.
Ronnie: Does anyone want to dance?


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2041]

Dwight: They should not be in that room.
Holly: That's so lame they didn't invite us.
Michael: You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: Let's go mini-golfing.
Holly: Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
Michael: Uh...
Holly: It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
Michael: Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
Dwight: Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
Michael: You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
Holly: Really?
Michael: Yeah.
Holly: Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
Michael: Good luck.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2042]

Michael: Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.


[Date: July 21, 2008, Session #2043]

Dwight: Party's over. You are so busted!
Michael: OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
Phyllis: You said fruit, Michael.
Michael: And what is that?
Phyllis: Cake.
Michael: You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
Dwight: Happy Birthday, Stanley! 


[Date: July 28, 2008, Session #2044]

Michael: Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.


[Date: July 28, 2008, Session #2045]

Ryan: And you got a goatee!
Michael: I did!
Ryan: Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
Michael: Yes.  Gooooo-tee!
Kevin: Firrrrre-duh guy! 
Ryan: Hey Kevin...  That's really funny.
Kevin: Yeah.
Ryan: It's great to see you Kev.
Kevin: You too.


[Date: July 28, 2008, Session #2046]

Darryl: Well you lost zero pounds.   No change.  On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
Michael: Hey, you know what?  I can't do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. 
Andy: Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon!  Who is slacking?
Holly: Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
Andy: NO!  I want names!


[Date: July 28, 2008, Session #2047]

Oscar: So how was your date?
Holly: Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he's cute, right?
Michael: 
Holly: What's wrong?
Michael:  Mmm--- mmm...  Um...


[Date: July 28, 2008, Session #2048]

Michael: Close the door.  This is your fault.
Jim: Nope.
Michael: Your stupid friend zone.
Jim: Mmm.
Michael: I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!


[Date: July 28, 2008, Session #2049]

Holly: Dieting's only half of it.
Michael: Mmm-hmm.  Saunas.
Holly: And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
Michael: Gah, the dreadmill. 


[Date: August 4, 2008, Session #2050]

Holly: ...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting---'
Michael:  Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
Holly: What are you doing?
Jim: Fair question.
Michael: I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.


[Date: August 4, 2008, Session #2051]

Michael: It's my sumo suit.  I just didn't inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.


[Date: August 4, 2008, Session #2052]

Michael: Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.
Jim: See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
Michael: If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?'
Kevin: Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
Michael: How do you know Michael Clump?
Oscar: Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
Michael: How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
Oscar: I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Dwight: No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Michael: No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
Dwight: Vamping.
Michael: Hey!  Why don't you just sit down, please?
Dwight: Eh, I've been sitting all day.
Michael: We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.   Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
Ryan: I did.
Michael: Why?
Ryan: 


[Date: August 4, 2008, Session #2053]

Michael: Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
Dwight: She should thank me.
Michael: Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
Phyllis: Why should I have to thank him?
Michael: You're right, you're right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
Dwight:  I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
Michael: Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don't you have a seat?   Let's all clap at Phyllis.  Ok!    When Michael Clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.    Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go.  Ok, I want you to look at her.  She's a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?
Ryan:  Everything.  She's perfect.
Meredith: I like her nails.
Michael: Ok, be more specific.
Meredith: I like her fingernails.
Phyllis: I like her purple dress.
Michael: What about her looks?
Creed: Hell of an ass.
Kelly: ...what else do people like?


[Date: August 4, 2008, Session #2054]

Michael: Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
Kelly: I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!
Michael: I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.   Mmmmmm.


[Date: August 11, 2008, Session #2055]

Michael: Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.
Ryan: Oh...
Michael: Ahaha, Yep! 
Oscar: How was Friday night?
Holly: Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
Oscar: He'll call.
Michael: Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
Darryl: You guys lost four pounds.
Michael: Hey!
Darryl: I say we have a parade.
Dwight: We better.
Michael: Excellent!  Good job.


[Date: August 11, 2008, Session #2056]

Michael: Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call?
Holly: I just got off... Kendall?  I just got off...
Michael: No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
Holly: Oh, no.
Micheal: Really?
Holly: No.
Micheal: Aach.
Holly: And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
Michael: I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He'll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he'll call.  If he doesn't, he is loco.
Holly: Thanks.  That's sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
Michael: Ugh.
Holly: Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That's all that really matters.
Michael: Wait, do we have until the end of the day?


[Date: August 11, 2008, Session #2057]

Michael:  Hey, is that healthy food?
Kelly: Nope.
Michael: We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
Jim: Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Michael: Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
Jim: Perfect.


[Date: August 11, 2008, Session #2058]

Dwight: God.  Where is Jim?
Holly: I'm calling it.  I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
Michael: Aww, really?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
Holly: Yeah?
Michael: ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
Holly: Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
Michael: I know.  I love Counting Crows.
Holly: Look at where my seats were.
Michael: Wow, really?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
Holly: Michael, you don't have to buy them.
Michael: I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
Holly: Ok.
Michael: Ok?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: Alright.  Alright!    Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: Is that good?
Holly: Yeah.
Jim: Hey, sorry everybody.
Dwight: What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
Andy: Wet Tuna!
Jim: Hey Dwight.
Michael: OK.
Jim: What's up, Meredith?
Meredith: Nothing.
Dwight: Dripping on me.
Michael: Darryl, would you do the honors?
Darryl: Two thousand one hundred seventy-five.  Sorry guys.
Michael: Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don't care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.


[Date: August 18, 2008, Session #2059]

Dwight: Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.   'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
Michael: No, you know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
Dwight: Classy.


[Date: August 18, 2008, Session #2060]

Michael: Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.
Meredith: One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...

Dwight: All right!
Michael: I want you to get your ass out of my face.


[Date: August 18, 2008, Session #2063]

Jim:  Yeah, well, if you're only free till three on Sunday and I can't get there till one, then it's gonna be pretty tight.
Michael:  That's what she said.
Jim:  Hey, can you not?
Dwight: Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Jim: No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Dwight: Gah! 


[Date: August 18, 2008, Session #2064]

Jan: I can't feel... I can't feel anything that you're doing, Michael.
Michael: Well...
Jan: It's like nothing's happening.
Michael: You're...you know what?  I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
Jan: Oh, just stop making excuses and just dig in there.
Michael: I'm digging.


[Date: August 18, 2008, Session #2065]

Michael: I know, it's...
Dwight: Will you be able to milk with those implants?
Jan: You mean breastfeed?
Dwight: Yeah.  Easy there, old girl. 
Jan: Uh, I'm fine, thank you.
Dwight: Okay.
Jan: Would you just call me when you're done with the errands, Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight:  Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
Michael: I want you to get the panty liners.
Dwight: Done.

[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2067]

Pam: Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple.  Look, it's official! 
Michael: Oh, good. My hooker's here.  Hi.
Pam: Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Michael: Yes I was. Yes I was.
Pam: Are you wearing anything under the robe?
Michael: That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2068]

Pam: This looks great, Michael.
Michael: Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Pam: Yes, please.
Michael: What shape?
Pam: ... Square is fine.
Michael: Alright.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2069]

Pam: So, what do you say we get started?

Michael: So how you feeling about the new company?
Pam: I feel good.  Wow.
Michael: You excited? About the new company?
Pam: Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
Michael: After breakfast.
Pam: We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second.  Michael. Stop for a second.
Michael: No, I'm whipping them.
Pam: No, I know you are.
Michael: Just let go.
Pam: Just let me have... Oh.
Michael: Let go, please. Just gimmee -
Pam: Fine!  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Michael: I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2070]

Michael:  I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Pam: You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
Michael: I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
Pam: I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Micheal: Whatever calms you down.
Pam: Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check.  Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
Michael: Don't patronize me, Pam.
Pam: I think you should get dressed.
Michael: I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
Pam: Michael, that seems impossible.
Michael: It's totally impossible!
Pam: We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Michael: Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Pam: Great.
Michael: Okay, Ryan.
Pam: No. What? Why?
Michael: He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Pam: No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
Michael: Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: He worked at that telemarketing place.
Pam: We'll find him.
Michael: Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Pam: Really?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: We have an investor already?
Michael: Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Pam: Michael, that's fantastic.
Michael: Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'.  Umm...
Pam: Hey! We need to get you dressed!


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2071]

Pam: I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship.  Hey! You look great!  Let's go!
Michael: Alright.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2072]

Pam: Next on the list - open the mail.
Michael: Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'
Pam: No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Michael: How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Pam: Next on the list --  song parodies.
Michael: Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.'
Pam: Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Michael: No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: We can do this.
Pam: We can do this.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2073]

Vikram: Where are we going?
Pam: We have a meeting with an investor today.
Michael: Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
Vikram: He seems really confident.
Pam: He can be.
Vikram: Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
Pam: Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2074]

Michael: Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  It's Michael.
Ryan: I'm swamped, Michael.  Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Michael: Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.

Michael: Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
Pam: Michael! What's going on?
Michael: I'm...
Pam: Hey, Ryan.
Ryan: Hey, you.
Michael: Excuse me. Yes?
Pam: This wasn't on the list.
Michael: Yes, it is.
Pam: No.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: It's not.
Michael: It is.
Pam:  When did you add this to the list?
Michael: Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Ryan: Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Pam: You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
Ryan: What do you make, secretary?
Supervisor: Back to work, shoe bitch!
Ryan: I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Michael: Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Ryan: What size shoes are you guys?
Michael: Uh, nine.
Ryan: What are those, a men's ten?
Pam: No.
Michael:  Look what he's doing.
Pam: What is he doing?
Michael: He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
Pam: Oh my God.

Michael: Right here.
Vikram: Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.

Ryan: Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Michael: Oh yeah.
Pam: Sure.
Ryan: It was indescribable.
Michael: Sounds awesome.
Pam: Beat.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2078]

Michael: People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2079]

Michael: Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
Nana: So let's hear it.
Michael: Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Nana: How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
Michael: By wanting it more. By working hard-
Nana: What's your mission statement?
Michael: Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2080]

Michael: And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana: Michael, I don't know about this.
Michael: Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Nana: I'm not so sure.
Michael: Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Nana: See, this is what concerns me.
Old Woman: We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
Michael: Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Nana: This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
Michael: Okay.
Nana: I love you, Michael. I do.
Michael: Okay.
Nana: But no. I mean it. No.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2081]

Ryan: Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Michael: Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
Pam: I can't do this.
Michael: What's that?
Pam: I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Michael: Blech.
Pam: I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Michael: Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Pam: We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
Michael: Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
Pam: How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
Michael: I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? 


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2082]

Michael: You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2083]

Michael: I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2084]

Michael:  Okay.
Pam: I could work here. I could see this.
Michael: It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Pam: Are you good?
Michael: Yeah, I'm good. You good?
Pam: I'm good.


[Date: April 2, 2009, Session #2085]

Michael: You know what they say, keep your friends close. 
Charles: Michael, you're back.
Michael: Yes, I am, Charles.
Charles: Mmmhmm.
Michael: Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.

[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2086]

Michael: It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.   Okay. Not gonna make this one. 


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2087]

Jim: LOVE the hair. 
Pam: Morning Michael!
Michael: Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! 


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2088]

Michael: I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2089]

Michael: We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Pam: What should we do now?
Michael: We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2090]

Michael: I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2091]

Michael: I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. 


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2092]

Ryan: You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Michael: Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Ryan: Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2093]

Michael: Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan: Pam's better at that stuff
Pam: That is so insulting.
Ryan: How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Pam: Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Ryan: I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Pam: Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Ryan: What the hell? 
Michael: Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Ryan: Yeah I make originals too.
Pam: Shut up!
Michael: Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam: Really!
Ryan: Yeah!
Toby: Not much? What's up with you?  Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO.  Hey does blue go with tan?
Michael: Would someone just make the copy?
Toby: I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Michael: Just make that copy okay?


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2094]

Pam: Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Ryan: That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Pam: I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Ryan: You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Pam: Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Ryan: This is from the sun.
Pam: Oh yeah I bet.
Michael: They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
Pam: Michael, we can hear you.
Michael: I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
Pam: Okay it's my turn.
Ryan: No don't take that, give that back!
Pam: Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Ryan: I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Pam: You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.'
Ryan: Yeah!
Pam: Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
Ryan: Go make a copy, secretary.
Pam: Come on! Ryan!


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2095]

Michael: They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2096]

Michael: Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Pam: Definitely.
Michael: Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam: We could work from home.
Ryan: Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Michael: Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Pam: .... Corner idea?
Michael: No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
Ryan: Rock the house!
Pam: How would we know that?


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2097]

Michael: That's my corner.
Pam: I thought that was your corner.
Michael: No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam: So my corner's the one with the copier?
Michael: Pam, I don't make the rules. 
Ryan: Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2098]

Michael: Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Stanley: I get it.  You need to see more?
Phyllis: It's really cute.
Michael: Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
Stanley: She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Michael: What for?
Stanley: I don't know. 
Ryan: Are we staying til five?
Michael: Yes.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2099]

Michael: Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2100]

Michael: Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan: I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Michael: Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Michael: Hey Pam.
Pam: Hey.
Michael: You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Pam: Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Michael: Well, at least you're still being honest with me.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2101]

Creed: These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Michael: These are shaped like paper.
Creed: Well I don't even want these. 
Meredith: I'll take them for my kid.


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2102]

Michael: I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  It is a disgusting sandwich.  And the reason I tell you this story.  Pick up the phone.
Pam: Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
Ryan: Keep going. 
Michael: Don't tell them we have free delivery! 
Pam: We already offered free delivery!
Michael: They don't know that!
Pam: Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Ryan: Write it down.
Michael: Give him a guarantee.
Pam: A guarantee of what?
Michael: Just say the word.
Pam: And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Michael: Yes!
Pam: I made a sale!
Ryan: Oh!
Michael: You did!
Pam: Oh!
Michael: Oh yeah!
Ryan: We did it !
Michael: She did it!
Michael: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 


[Date: April 9, 2009, Session #2103]

Michael: Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.


[Date: April 16, 2009, Session #2104]

Michael: Hup! 


[Date: April 16, 2009, Session #2105]

Pam: Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Michael: Hup! 
Pam: We're getting pretty good at it.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2106]

Michael: Hey.
Dwight: Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Michael:  Is this good?
Dwight: They have some great kitchen ideas.
Michael: Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
Dwight: It's small, I know.
Michael: I really appreciate it.
Dwight: Thanks, Michael.  Wait, what is this?
Michael: It's for your trouble.
Dwight: Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Michael: No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Dwight: Michael, you know I can't take this.
Michael: Yes, I do.
Dwight: But don't forget you owe me $10.
Michael: That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Dwight: Michael.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2107]

Michael: Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
Pam: I'm not gonna do that.
Michael: That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Ryan: I can get there.
Michael: Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Ryan: Oh, awesome.
Michael: Bring it in. Morning cheer. 
Michael, Pam & Ryan: U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2108]

Michael:  I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight: I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
Michael: Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Dwight: No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Michael: I'm not following you.
Dwight: Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Michael: Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
Dwight: Good, do you see what I'm saying?
Michael: Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Dwight: No.
Michael: Can I use it? 
Dwight: No.
Michael:  Dwight, are you talking about us?
Dwight: It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Michael: Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Dwight: It is the situation that we are in now.
Michael: So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Dwight: I'm not a barbarian.
Michael: Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight: I will.
Michael: Dwight?
Dwight: Yes?
Michael: Is the cool new guy Charles?
Dwight: I've said too much.
Michael: Is it Stanley?


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2109]

Michael: Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Dwight: I'm sorry, Michael
Charles:  Hi, Michael.
Michael: Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Charles: No, Mich-Michael.
Michael: Dwight, run!
Charles: Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Michael: You be cool.
Charles: Yes.
Michael: Just-what's going on?
Charles: We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Michael: Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Charles: He did.
Dwight: I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Charles: Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Michael: I. Understand. Nothing.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2110]

Michael:  Wow.
Pam: Michael, are you alright?
Michael: It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Pam: Tell us what you're talking about.
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Pam: We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Michael: I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2111]

Dwight:  Dwight Schrute.
Michael: Hello, traitor.
Dwight: I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Michael: I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Pam: Michael!
Michael: I'm just getting hardcore with him.
Ryan: Finally.
Michael: Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2112]

Michael:  Is Mr. Schofield there?
Automated phone voice: If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. 


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2113]

Michael:  Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.  Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Ryan: Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Pam: I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Michael: Wow. High score?


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2114]

Michael: Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
Dwight: I would like to arrange a truce.
Michael: So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
Dwight: Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Michael: No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Dwight: In which direction?
Michael: Toward the sun.
Dwight: At what time?
Michael: Noon.
Dwight: That-
Michael: You have two seconds. 


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2115]

Dwight:  Michael.  Sorry.
Michael: Dwight.
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: I hope you're not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Dwight: You were making me do things that were not all right.
Michael: So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
Dwight: And not come through for you?
Michael: If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Dwight: I want a truce.
Michael: I do too.
Dwight: Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Michael: Cooper's.
Dwight: I had fish yesterday.
Michael: Damn it.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2116]

Michael:  Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Dwight: Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Michael: Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
Dwight: I hit a bear.
Michael: What?
Dwight: He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.  Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Michael: Yeah, sure.
Dwight: Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? 
Michael: Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2117]

Pam:  Sounds neat.
Ryan: We can spend a couple days there.
Pam: Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Michael:  Yeah.
Dwight: Did you enjoy your lunch?
Michael: Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
Dwight: No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Michael: No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic.  You?
Dwight: Me.
Michael: What about our truce?
Dwight: I broke it.
Michael: On purpose?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Why?
Dwight: You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Michael: Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Dwight: And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Michael: Oh.  Bastard!


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2118]

Dwight: And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife.  I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Michael: Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Dwight: Sure. That'd be fine.
Michael: If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Dwight: This is war and that is what happens.
Michael: Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Dwight: Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Michael: Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Dwight: Michael! Michael!
Michael: You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Secretary: Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
Michael: Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Dwight: Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Michael: Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield: Michael, good to see you.
Michael: Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.

Michael:  Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Mr. Schofield: Really?
Michael: Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Dwight: Are you saying you invented paper?


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2120]

Michael: What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
Dwight: It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! 
Secretary: Uh, hello, Dwight.
Dwight: Spin move.
Secretary: Oh-
Dwight: Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Mr. Schofield: Dwight, I'm in a meeting.
Michael: That's very rude.
Dwight: I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Mr. Schofield: Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
Dwight: La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Michael: I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Dwight: Come on.
Michael: Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
Dwight: What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Mr. Schofield: Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
Michael: That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Mr. Schofield: Uh, ok, sure.
Michael: Good, good, good. I will see you.
Dwight: Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
Mr. Schofield: Excuse me?


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2121]

Michael: I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2122]

Michael: I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2123]

Michael: He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2124]

Michael: Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
Ryan: Uncle Dave?
Michael: He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
Ryan: That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Pam: When are you ever responsible for your actions?
Ryan: Get off my ass, you hag.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.


[Date: April 17, 2009, Session #2125]

Michael: Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2126]

Michael: It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2127]

Michael:  Time to make the donuts.   Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.   De-nied!


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2128]

Michael: Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!   Hey Pam.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2129]

Pam: You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Michael: Milk and sugar.
Pam: Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.   Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Michael: That's what I said.
Pam: Do you drink this every day?
Michael: Every morning.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2130]

Michael: We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
Pam:  Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2131]

Michael: You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Ryan: Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Michael: Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Pam: Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Michael: Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
Pam: Yeah, I know what a loft is.
Ryan: Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
Michael: Most do in the magazines.
Ryan: Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Michael: We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2132]

Michael: How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Financial Guy: Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--
Michael: They are correct, sir.
Financial Guy: Then you can't afford to pay him anything.
Michael: Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
Financial Guy: Your prices are too low.
Michael: Lowest in town.
Financial Guy: Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?
Pam: Corporate greed?
Ryan: Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Financial Guy: Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct.
Ryan: Yeah.
Financial Guy: But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
Michael: Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
Ryan: Explain what you think that is.
Financial Guy: Okay.
Michael: Explain that.
Financial Guy: As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care...
Michael: Well, we don't--
Financial Guy: ...business expansion--
Michael: Whatever, yeah.
Financial Guy: At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.
Michael: Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Financial Guy: They're actually putting you out of business.
Michael: Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Ty: It's a program.  There's no such thing--
Michael: Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.
Ty:  Crunch.
Pam: Did it help?


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2133]

Michael: Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing.  Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2134]

Michael: Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Pam: Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
Michael: I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.
Pam: You want to hear something sad?
Michael: I would love that.
Pam: So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Ryan: I never went to Thailand.
Pam: Really?
Ryan: I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Michael: Was it nice?
Ryan: Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Michael: I love Pad Thai.
Ryan: You've never had Pad Thai.
Michael: No.  There's a lot I haven't done.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2135]

Michael:  Hmm?
Jim: Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Michael: We're not hiring, Jim.
Jim: Actually here for something else.
Michael: Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
Jim: You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Ryan: Oh, that's nice.
Jim: David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Pam: Seriously?  Are you being serious?
Ryan: He's bluffing, Pam.
Michael: Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
Jim: Oh!
Michael: No-- We don't have--
Jim: Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Michael:  Uh... Yes.
Pam: Yes.
Ryan: Maybe.
Jim: Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Michael: Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
Jim: Missed the last part.
Michael: That's a pun.
Jim: Got it.
Michael: Yep. Oh... wow.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2136]

Ryan: Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Michael: Of course not.
Ryan: That we're having any problem at all.
Michael: Nope, nope, nope.
Pam: Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Michael: Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2137]

Michael: Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Pam: No, Michael.
Michael: Ah...
Ryan: No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Pam: We have to come from a position of strength.
Michael: I'm good, I'm good.
Ryan: Just put it out of your mind.
Michael: It is.  I'm good.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2138]

Michael: Hello.
Erin: Hi.
Michael: Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.   Well, well, well. How the turntables...


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2139]

David: Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Michael: And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Ryan: Michael, you  haven't even heard--
Michael: Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
David: $12,000.00
Michael: Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2140]

David: Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Michael: I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
David: Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Michael:  We'll have to talk--
Charles: What?
Ryan: We'll have to talk about this.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Just amongst ourselves.
David: Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Michael: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Pam: $60,000.00
Michael: We are so rich.
Pam: Are you kidding me?


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2141]

David: So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Michael: No.
Pam: Can you give us another minute please?
David: Yeah.
Charles: Oh, okay.
Pam: Michael.
Ryan: How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Pam: Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Michael: It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
Ryan: I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
Pam: No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Michael: Agreed?
Pam: Agreed.  But that's all, okay.
Ryan: Yeah, discuss these things--
Michael: Shut up, shut up.  Hello?


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2142]

Michael: I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
Charles: They don't make them anymore.
Michael: And I want Charles gone.
David: I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Charles: That's very kind of you to say, David.
Michael: I need him gone.
David: No.
Michael: Okay, then I want Pam back.
David: Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
Michael: Sales.
Pam: Thank you.
David: Pam's not a salesperson.
Michael: Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
Pam: That's right.
David: Okay.  Please continue.
Michael: And Ryan.
David: Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Michael: You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
David: Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Michael: And dental this time.
David: Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Michael: These are our demands.
David: Your company cannot be worth that much.
Michael: Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
David: Michael--
Michael: That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
David: Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
Michael: Can we have the room please?
David: Yeah. 
Ryan: Yes, yes, yes!
Pam: Alright!
Michael: Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2143]

Michael: There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.


[Date: April 23, 2009, Session #2144]

Charles: Hey, guys--
Michael: No, no. You're done.

[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2145]

Michael: Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
Ryan:  Who is it?
Pam:  Who is it?
Michael:  It's Michael Scott.   Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2146]

Michael: Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.   And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
Dwight:   Wh--what are you doing?
Michael: If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Angela: Okay.
Michael: Yes.
Angela: People are dressed inappropriately.
Michael: Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
Jim: Can you give us a hint?


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2147]

Michael: When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2148]

Michael: Oscar, what were you going to say?
Oscar: Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
Michael: All right.
Erin: Do I still have a job here?
Michael: Not important.  Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
Dwight: Wait, what?
Stanley: How is that going to work?
Michael: It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
Phyllis: You mean the clients you stole from us.
Dwight: Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
Michael: No, you lost those clients.
Andy: I call foul, sir.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Michael: Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2149]

Michael:  There you are, my friend.
Ryan: Oh, thanks, man.
Michael: Pamela.
Pam: Thank, Michael.
Michael: Yep.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2150]

Pam: That one's great.
Michael: I know.
Ryan: You look so classy in that picture.
Michael: I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
Jim: Hey, you have a second?
Michael: Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Jim: Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
Michael: Okay, well---
Ryan: Tough.
Michael: I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Jim: This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Michael: Against who?
Ryan: You.  Us.
Pam: What?
Ryan: It's gotta be because they all want their clients.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2151]

Michael: The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2152]

Michael: Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
Pam: Mm-hmmm.
Michael: That was  us, right there.
Pam: We were something else.
Ryan: What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Ryan: Chiklis style.
Michael: Yeah, the Commish.
Ryan: Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Michael: Yeah, yeah. The Shield.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2153]

Michael: Hey gang. Where you been?
Dwight: Lunch.
Michael: Where'd you eat?
Phyllis: A restaurant.
Michael: What'd you have, Stanley?
Andy: I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
Stanley: I had Mexican food.
Michael: So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?   Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Ryan: That looks great.
Michael: Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
Ryan: I can eat.
Michael: I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Dwight: It's pony.
Michael: Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Andy: Dijonnaise.
Michael: Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
Pam: Mmm.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2154]

Ryan: I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Dwight: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Ryan: Exactly.
Dwight: That's my client.
Ryan: Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Dwight: Give me the phone.
Ryan: Things have been generally good.
Dwight: Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Ryan: Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
Dwight: Hi, Mr. Bart.
Ryan: At these prices with this service...
Dwight: Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
Ryan: You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
Ryan: No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
Dwight: I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness.  Ryan!
Phyllis: Ryan, hand the phone over.
Ryan: Stop flustering me, everybody!
Stanley: Who let this boy on the phone?
Dwight: Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Pam: You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
Dwight: You're a secretary! What do you know?
Ryan: Okay.
Dwight: And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Michael: Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
Dwight: We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Michael: Who quits?
Phyllis: Me.
Stanley: And me.
Andy: Me too.
Michael: You guys gotta be kidding.
Dwight: No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Michael: I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.   There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
Stanley: You want us to apologize to you?
Michael: Yes I do.
Andy: That's completely backwards.
Michael: It's frontward's.
Phyllis: Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Stanley: That's right.
Dwight: Right.
Phyllis: Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2155]

Michael: No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2156]

Michael: I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Dwight: Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Michael: Whatever you guys did earlier.
Dwight: I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Michael: Just do it, okay?
Dwight: I'll do--
Michael: Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Dwight: I'll do the best I can.
Michael: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: Deceit does not come easy to me.
Michael: Okay, okay, okay.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2157]

Michael: So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
Stanley: Are you giving us our clients back?
Michael: If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
Stanley: Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Michael: They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Phyllis: Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Michael: Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
Stanley: So?
Michael: Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.   However, I rescind my apology.
Dwight: That's fair.
Michael: You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Darryl: What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2158]

Creed: So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
Jim: Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Creed: I thought you were gay.
Jim: Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Creed: I don't know.
Michael: Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Jim: Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Michael:  And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
Creed: Challenge.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2159]

Michael: I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Jim: I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Michael: You're close with Pam too.
Jim: Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Michael: Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
Jim: Well, that's--
Michael: I like his hair.
Jim: Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Michael: Okay.
Jim: He definitely stole my iPod.
Michael: That sounds pretty biased.
Jim: You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Michael: Okay. Pam, pros.
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Michael: I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
Jim: That's not true.
Michael: I don't need to tell you that.
Jim: I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Michael: I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
Jim: And I won't.
Michael: Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
Jim: All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Michael: Oh, wow!  Whoa!
Jim: Take it easy.
Michael: Ho-ho, man!  Wow.  Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2160]

Michael: I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2161]

Michael: Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.   Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
Pam: Just tell me.
Michael: I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
Pam: No, okay.
Michael: I'm sorry, sorry.
Pam: Okay, I get it.  Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?   Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
Michael:  Yes, you did.
Pam: I did?
Michael: Yep.
Pam: For real, you're not kidding?
Michael: No, you--no.
Pam: I did?
Michael: No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
Pam: Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
Michael:  Oh, oh!
Pam: Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
Michael: You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Pam: Oh.  I really thought I didn't get it.
Michael: Oh, really?
Pam: Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
Michael: Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
Pam: What about Ryan?
Michael: I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
Pam: Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Michael: I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
Pam: Thanks, Michael.
Michael: Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Pam: Erin.
Michael: Could you send her in?
Pam:  Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Michael: Hello.
Erin: Hi.
Michael: Have a seat.


[Date: April 30, 2009, Session #2162]

Michael: This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.   Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
Erin: Oh, I can go.
Michael: He will be ushering you out.  
Erin: Oh!
Michael: Oh, your face!  Oh!
Erin: Is--do the people--
Michael: No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Erin: Oh!
Michael: Oh...
Erin: Do they not like me, though?
Michael: I don't know, actually.
Erin: Okay.

[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2163]

Michael:  Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2164]

Michael: Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Dwight: I do.
Michael: Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Pam: Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Michael: Oh, really? Ok.
Pam: Just sent it.
Michael: What about the rest of you? 


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2165]

Michael: At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2166]

Michael: Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ryan: I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2167]

Michael: Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Angela: No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Phyllis: Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Michael: What?
Phyllis: Work.
Michael: Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2168]

Pam: Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
Michael:  I... was just learning... to... love.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2169]

Erin: Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Michael: No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Erin: Well, I like to swim.
Michael: That's good.
Erin: You have a cool place to come hang.
Michael: If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Erin: Thanks.
Michael: Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Erin: Wow.
Michael: Now you got it.
Erin: Now I do got it.
Michael: Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Erin: Oh, yeah.
Michael: You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Erin: That's rule #1.
Michael: Ok. I love it. I love it.
Erin: Whew.
Michael: I love it.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2170]

Michael: Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2171]

Michael: Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like  Dave died or something.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2172]

Michael: Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Oscar: Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Michael: I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy:  Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Michael: Andy's afwaid?
Andy: Yes.
Michael: Are you all afwaid?
Dwight: No.
Michael: Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Pam: What?
Michael: Funk is the problem and the solution.
Jim: That makes sense.
Michael: I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Oscar: Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael: Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
Dwight:  All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Meredith: This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Michael: No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
Andy: It's like a haunted disco.
Michael: ... with coffee but without the haunted.
Phyllis: It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Michael: It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Erin: It's a cafe disco.
Michael: Exactly.
Kevin: So, like, a disco cafe?
Michael: Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2173]

Michael: Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Holdin' down the fort.
Kevin: Yeah. This place is great.
Michael: Thank you.
Angela: Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Kevin: I'm sorry.
Michael: This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin: Yeah. Respect the lei.
Angela: Come.
Michael: Kevin, stay.
Angela: Kevin, come.
Michael: Kevin, stay.
Angela: Kevin, come.
Michael: Stay, stay.
Angela: Come on, right now.
Michael: Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Angela: Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Kevin:  Is there a cookie?
Michael: Mmm-hmm.
Angela: Wha -
Michael: Come on.
Angela: Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Kevin: I wanted a cookie.
Angela: Completely unacceptable.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2174]

Michael: Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2175]

Michael: Phyllis?
Phyllis: Hi.
Michael: Hey!
Phyllis: Hey. I like.
Michael:  Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Phyllis: Oh! Mother ******!
Michael: Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Phyllis: Back!
Michael: Oh, wow! What did you do?
Phyllis: 
Michael: You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Phyllis: Wow! Sorry!
Michael: Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Dwight: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Michael: No. No. No.
Dwight: Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Phyllis: It's my back.
Michael: It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
Phyllis: Call a doctor.
Michael: We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Phyllis: No. Call Bob.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2176]

Michael: Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
Dwight: Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Michael: I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Dwight: What do you think history is?
Michael: It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2177]

Michael:  Alright. Here we go.
Dwight: Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Michael: You having fun?
Erin: Oh, my God! What happened?
Michael: What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Phyllis: What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight: You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Michael: Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oscar: What happened to Phyllis?
Michael: Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Angela: Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Michael: Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. 
Stanley: I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Michael: You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Erin: Yes.
Michael: I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Erin: Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Michael: I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
Dwight:  I'm gonna need two able bodied men.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2178]

Michael: I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2179]

Michael: Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Creed: I hear it, too, Boss.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2180]

Michael: It's better than I imagined it!


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2181]

Michael: Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Erin: Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Angela: Stop!
Michael: Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Angela: No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Michael: Oh. Alright. There you go.
Angela: No. You need to sign them all.
Michael: No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
Angela: Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Michael: I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.'  No.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2182]

Creed: Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Michael: Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Creed: No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2183]

Michael: Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
Angela: You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Michael: No... cleaning... up.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2184]

Michael: Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
Phyllis: Wanna dance, Dwight?
Dwight: Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Bob Vance: Mind if I steal my wife?
Dwight: You can't steal what is legally your property.
Bob Vance: Are those staples?


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2185]

Michael: You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Jim: We're gonna stay.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Michael: Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2186]

Michael: Would you like to dance?
Angela: No. 


[Date: May 7, 2009, Session #2187]

Michael: My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.


[Date: May 14, 2009, Session #2188]

Michael: 


[Date: May 14, 2009, Session #2189]

Jim:  Three, two, one... 
Michael:  Uh oh. What's so funny?
Pam: You had to be there.
Michael: Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.


[Date: May 14, 2009, Session #2190]

Michael: See you later!
Dwight: Bye Michael!  Yeah!


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2191]

Kevin: Michael, isn't that Holly?
Michael: We're just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Holly: Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
Michael: Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
Holly: All right.
Michael: All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
Holly: Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Michael: A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
AJ: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Holly: Lemonade sounds great.
Michael: Okay.
AJ: I'd love an iced tea, actually.
Michael: You can go to hell.  I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2192]

Michael: I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2193]

Michael: What is up with you two, Holly?
Holly: Um, not much.
AJ: We're designing a house.
Michael: Cool. For who?
AJ: For us.
Michael: Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
Holly: I remember your chair pants idea. 
AJ: I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
Michael: All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Holly: Okay, yeah.
AJ: You guys are really gonna do this?
Michael: You bet your fat ass we are.


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2194]

Michael: Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Holly: Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Michael: That's right.
Holly:  Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
Michael: Newspapers for sale!


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2195]

Michael: I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Holly: Ooh, yes please.  Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Michael:  What?
Holly: Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Michael: Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
Holly: Crystal cool.


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2196]

Michael: We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Holly:  We could do Back to the Future.
Michael: Oh!
Holly: We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. 
Michael: Could we get a Delorean?
Holly: Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Michael: Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
Holly: Dun-der. Dun-der...
Michael: Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! 
Holly: Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Michael: No. No.
Holly: Oh.
Michael: We're circling it.
Holly: Hmm...


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2197]

David: Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Michael:  Uh, it's a sketch now.
David: Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. 
Michael: And now, presenting...
Both: SlumDunder Mifflinaire! 
Michael: 
Holly: Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Michael: Yes, I am.
Holly: For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Michael: Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
Holly: That is correct!  How did you know that?! 
Michael:  Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Holly:  Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Michael: Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
Holly: I'm Robert Dunder.
Michael: I'm Robert Mifflin.  Ah, okay. 
Holly: Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Michael: Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Holly: That is correct!
Michael: Yes!


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2198]

Holly: The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Michael: I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
Holly: That is correct!
Man from Buffalo:  What is he talking about?
Holly:  How did you know that?!
Michael: David Wallace told me!!
Woman from Buffalo: David, is this true?
David: Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
Man from Buffalo: Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
Holly: They didn't know?
Michael:  I guess not.
David: I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Woman from Buffalo: And?
David: We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
Man from Buffalo:  You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it. 


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2199]

David: How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Michael: Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
David: What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Michael: Thank you.
David: Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Michael: Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2200]

Michael: Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Holly: Hindsight.
Michael: Should've had hindsight.
Holly: How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Michael: I think it went well. I think it was good.
Holly: There weren't any laughs.
Michael: No, it was a tough audience.
Holly: Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Michael: Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Holly: Well, I'm glad we did it.
Michael: Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Holly: I can't wait.


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2201]

Holly: What'd you think?
AJ: I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...
Michael: Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Holly:  Okay. So good to see you.
Michael: Good to see you.  AJ.
AJ: Michael. 


[Date: May 15, 2009, Session #2202]

Michael: I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.


[Date: October 9, 2008, Session #2203]

Pam:  Well, I should go.
Jim: Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Pam: No, don't.  I'm mad at them.
Jim: Why, what happened?
Pam: Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
Jim: Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
Pam: What?  Why not?
Jim: I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Pam: Come on, it won't be that bad.
Jim: OK.  You know what?  Here we go.  Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
Pam:  Hi everyone!
Oscar: I thought you were already engaged.
Jim: Nope.
Angela: That was Roy.  She was engaged to Roy.
Jim: Thank you Angela.
Kevin: I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
Jim: Yes.
Andy: A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
Jim: To get married.
Dwight:  She's not a virgin, you know.
Pam: Wow.
Michael:  What's going on?
Pam: No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. 
Creed: The tall guy got engaged.
Michael:  To be married?
Jim: Yep. 
Pam: Sorry.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2204]

Dwight:  I got it, I got it. 
Michael & Holly: Let's get ethical!  Ethical!  I wanna get ethical!  Let's get into Ethics yeah!  Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk!  Your body talk.  Let me hear your body talk.
Michael: WOO!  Alright!


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2205]

Michael: Why are you helping her?  You're not even dating.'  She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2206]

Michael: Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! 
Holly: Thanks Michael.  Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
Kevin: Oh come on!  He's right there.  He was hired.   Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
Jim: Nice. 
Ryan: Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six?  Anyone know Joanna on that show?  In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Michael:  Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
Holly: Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
Phyllis: I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Holly: Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
Michael: Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. 
Holly: Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
Kelly: What?
Holly: Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
Stanley: This meeting.
Andy: Hey-oh!
Dwight: Yes.
Michael:  Can't set 'em up like that.
Kelly: Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.  I'll do it.  I don't care.
Meredith: I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Holly: Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
Michael: Can we have a moment?   Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Michael: Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
Holly: Well, I just have to get through the binder.
Michael: Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
Holly: I am?
Micheal: Yeah, don't think about the stakes.  It'll freak you out.
Holly: Ok.  Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That's not right.
Michael:  Lauren,  enough with the pencils.
Holly: No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.
Oscar: That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Andy: I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
Oscar: Exactly, Andy.
Andy: Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,
Dwight: It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Andy: No that's... not how it works.
Michael: I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
Holly: Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
Michael: Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
Oscar: Pass.
Michael: I will go first.  When I discovered
Holly: What was the dilemma?
Michael: To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
Holly: Oh--- no no no.
Michael: Yeah, .  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
Oscar: Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
Michael: A siesta!
Dwight: Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
Jim: Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Dwight: Never!
Michael: You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
Kelly: Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
Michael: Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else?
Holly: No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
Michael: Mmm...
Angela: I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
Michael: Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
Meredith: I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Michael: Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Meredith: Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Jim: Jackpot.
Michael: Ach! Wuh---
Holly: Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
Meredith: Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Michael: That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got?  You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work.   Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
Holly: Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
Michael: Oh...
Holly: I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
Micheal: Nnyeah.  What ya gonna do?


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2207]

Holly: So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
Meredith: Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
Michael: Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
Meredith: Am I in trouble here or something?
Michael: No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
Holly: No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?
Meredith: Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Micheal: Ughh!  For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag.
Holly: What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
Meredith: Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself.  Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Holly: Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
Meredith: Well... I'm not quitting.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2208]

Jim:  Yawn.  Four seconds.
Dwight: What are you doing?
Jim: Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Dwight: Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd.  Really?  Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- 
Jim: Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
Dwight: There is no way that that was--- 
Jim:  One second.
Michael: Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Holly: It's Mike-raculous.
Michael: Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
Holly: Sounds good.
Michael: Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Holly: Oh I already bought this...
Michael: Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.    Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2209]

Holly: So, I've gone over corporate policy.
Michael: What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
Holly: Oh, it's very nice.
Michael: Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?
Holly: Mmm.
Michael: Wow, that sounds so... warm.
Holly: In Summer.
Michael: Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
Holly: Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
Michael: Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Holly: Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
Michael: Wow, terminator, terminator.
Holly: I'm from da future.
Michael: Yeah.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2210]

Michael: I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
Holly: Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.
Michael: Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.
Holly: We punish her?
Michael: Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.
Holly: I don't think we could enforce that.
Michael: I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
Holly: A chastity belt.
Michael: No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2211]

Michael: I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
Holly: No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
Michael: Yes.
Holly: What am I saying?
Michael: Well... bleh busted.  I don't...
Holly: I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
Michael: Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
Holly: It's not a family.  It's a workplace.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2212]

Michael: I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. 


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2213]

Ryan: Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
Michael: What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Ryan: Two HR reps.
Michael: You get me.
Holly: Can I sit?
Michael: I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
Kendall:  Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..
Holly: Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
Michael: Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
Kendall: Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action.
Holly: Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
Kendall: Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area.  Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.
Holly: Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
Kendall: I thought it was clear with you, Holly.  Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.
Holly: No, I understand.
Kendall: Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion.
Holly: No.  I can do it.
Kendall: Good.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2214]

Michael: How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2215]

Holly: Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.
Andy: No way, lady.
Kevin: It's a trap.
Holly: Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
Meredith: Don't sign anything.
Michael: Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
Stanley: It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
Michael: Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! 
Meredith: Am I getting fired?
Michael: Now is really not the time, Meredith.


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2216]

Holly: Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?
Michael: Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?
Jim: Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?
Ryan: Fraud, Jim, Fraud.
Jim: Fraud.
Ryan: Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
Kevin: Wait, what?


[Date: October 10, 2008, Session #2217]

Meredith: Hey, how did it go?
Michael: Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?
Meredith: Okay. 
Michael: What do you need?
Meredith: I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Michael: I... really want to keep you.
Meredith: Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Michael: Wait, what?
Meredith: I wish Toby was still here.
Michael: Nnnngah!

[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2218]

Dwight:  Hey Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
Michael: OK, just remember to keep breathing.
Dwight: My cervix is ripening.
Michael: OK, good.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2219]

Dwight: Michael! My water's breaking!
Michael: Oh, OK! OK!
Dwight: Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Michael: I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
Dwight: Right. Highways or surface roads?
Michael: I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
Dwight: No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
Michael: I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
Dwight: It's about adapting to the circumstances.
Michael:  Andy, would you like to have my baby?
Andy: Yes! Yeah.   Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
Dwight: No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! 
Michael: All right, OK.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
Dwight: The pressure!  The pressure!
Michael: Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
Dwight: Aaaaaaaa!
Michael: Aaaaaaaa!


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2220]

Michael: Just keep pushing...
Dwight:  Hold me!
Michael: I'm right here.
Dwight: Cradle my head!
Michael: I'm right here, I'm right here.
Dwight: I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
Michael:  All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
Dwight: Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Michael: Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late.
Dwight: No! I don't want natural!
Michael: No.  You have to just push it out!
Dwight: OK!
Michael: Keep simulating.
Dwight: Aaaaaaaa!
Michael: OK!
Dwight: Do you have the Sharpie?!
Michael: Keep simulating.
Dwight: Do you have the Sharpie?!
Michael: Yes, I do!
Dwight: OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
Michael: OK.
Dwight: Ready?!
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Aaaaaaaa!
Michael: Aaaaaaaa!  It's coming!  Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Dwight: Butter. Newborns are slippery.
Michael: Nice touch.  Good.  Let's try that again.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2221]

Michael:  It is going to be the happiest day of my life. 


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2222]

Michael: Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
Phyllis: No.
Michael: Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
Angela: Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name 'Chevy.' And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name 'Astird.'
Phyllis: That can't be right.
Angela: Michael wrote down 'Astird.'
Michael: She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
Meredith: Ass...turd.
Michael: I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2223]

Michael: It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2224]

Phyllis: I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Michael:  Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
Phyllis: Sorry.
Michael: Make the party.  Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2225]

Michael: Ahoy, matey.
Holly: Ahoy.
Michael: Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
Holly: Good.
Michael: Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  It's all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
Holly: Of course. Yeah.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2226]

Michael: So this is Astird.
Jan: Astrid.
Michael: Oh, OK.  Why didn't you call me?
Jan: Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
Michael: I could have helped.
Jan: And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
Michael: Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
Jan: OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
Michael: No, I don't!
Jan: I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
Michael: Can I hold her?
Jan: Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
Michael:  All right, OK.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2227]

Michael: I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2228]

Michael:  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...
Jan: trid.
Michael: ...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
Jan: Well...
Michael:  Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go.  Lion King!
Jan: Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high.  I'll take that.
Michael: OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
Holly: You OK?  You seem kind of...
Michael:  I'm fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2229]

Michael: Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
Kevin: Michael, the baby's already been born.
Michael: Uh, duh.
Kevin: So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Michael: No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do.
Kevin: OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Michael: All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
Jan: Thank you.  That's very sweet of you.
Michael: Whatta we got?
Angela: Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
Michael: Oh!
Jan: Thank you.
Michael: She already has a stroller.
Kelly: And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
Oscar: She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
Dwight: Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Michael: OK, what else?


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2230]

Andy: So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
Jan: Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.
Angela: You gave birth in a tub?
Jan: Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
Kelly: Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
Jan: Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
Creed: Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Jan: Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
Creed: Ugh.
Stanley: I'm done.
Oscar: Me too.
Jan: And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. 
Michael: Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2231]

Michael: I could have helped.
Jan: You're sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I...  but...  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
Michael:  Uh, yeah.
Jan: All right.  Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I'm exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529.  Wake me in twenty.
Michael:  I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
Michael: Phyllis?  Could you take-.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2232]

Michael: Hey guys.
Darryl: What's up, Mike?
Michael: Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
Darryl: You a baby daddy?
Michael: Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
Darryl: Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.
Michael: I just saw this baby daddy-
Darryl: You should stop calling yourself 'baby daddy.'
Michael: Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
Darryl: Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
Michael: Well-
Darryl: You feel connected to his baby over there?
Michael: It's- that's different.
Darryl: You feel connected to this? 
Michael: That's not a baby.
Darryl: You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
Michael:  Could I?
Darryl: No.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2233]

Jan: Michael, I need your help.
Michael:  I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
Jan: Uh... come on.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2234]

Michael: Sure you can't stay a little longer?
Jan: Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
Michael: All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
Jan: You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
Dwight: Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Jan: Ah.  Thanks, Dwight.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2235]

Jan: OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
Michael: OK?
Jan: Don't date Holly.
Michael: Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
Jan: Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I'll see you... soon.
Michael: All right.
Jan: OK.


[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2236]

Holly: You still gonna be mean to me?
Michael:  You wanna go out?
Holly: Yes.

[Date: October 16, 2008, Session #2238]

Angela: All right, how about we play the game where we guess how big the mother's belly is?
Michael: Oh! OK!
Jan: Well...
Angela: How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?
Kevin: Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
Angela: Kevin, relax.
Jan: OK, you know what, I don't think I need to do this one, because I only gained twelve pounds and I'm just going to get rid of all of that, so...
Michael: Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares.
Jan: OK, give me the roll.  I'll do it.
Michael: Do the boobs!
Jan: Yeah, we're not doing my boobs, Michael.  OK, seven, someone give me the prize.   Oh, it's OK...
Holly: Did she really just have a baby? She's so beautiful.
Jim: Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
Michael: Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You're ruining the party.


[Date: October 23, 2008, Session #2239]

Michael: Hey.
Holly: Hello.
Michael: That was really fun last night.
Holly: Yeah, it was nice.
Michael: I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Holly: Oh, that would be great. You need that.
Michael: Yeah?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: Oh really?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: Well...
Holly: It would help.
Michael: I, uh...  I let her win.
Holly:  No, he didn't.
Michael: So, when, um, can I see you again?
Holly: Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? 
Michael: No.
Holly: I don't care, free tonight.
Michael: Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
Holly:  Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.

Holly:  No more.
Michael: Tonight's so...
Holly: No more.
Michael: Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
Holly: Thank you, you too.
Michael: You're welcome.


[Date: October 23, 2008, Session #2240]

Michael: In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.


[Date: October 23, 2008, Session #2241]

Holly: Oh, the mall could be fun.
Michael: Yeah.
Holly: We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
Michael: Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?
Holly: ...Hell yeah.
Michael: Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
Holly: Yeah, that's good.


[Date: October 23, 2008, Session #2242]

Michael: Probably get soup or something light.


[Date: October 23, 2008, Session #2243]

Holly:  It's time to go.
Michael: No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.   I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
Holly: You're crazy, go crazy.


[Date: October 23, 2008, Session #2244]

Holly:  Oh, I forgot my keys.
Michael: Do you need 'em?
Holly: Yeah, lets go grab them.
Michael: All right.
Holly: Oh, after vous. 
Michael: Thank vous.  What? Oh! 
Holly: I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
Michael: Not if we turn these dials  all the way down.  Now they can't hear us at all.
Holly: Oh, good.
Michael: We're totally alone.


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2245]

Michael: Oh, my God, what happened?
Jim: We were robbed last night.
Dwight: Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Holly: Can I talk to you for a second?
Michael: Yeah. Oh... oh!
Holly: That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
Michael: No, did you?
Holly: Michael I think this is our fault.
Michael: Oh, no, my God.
Holly: Oh...
Michael: Oh my God!


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2246]

Michael: So much for sex without consequences.

Michael: We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2248]

Michael: To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2249]

Phyllis: I think it's a fun idea.
Michael: Thank you.
Phyllis: We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Michael: Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
Phyllis: Move on, Michael.
Michael: Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
Oscar: So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Michael: I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
Jim: Do you need us for any of this?
Michael: Do I?


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2250]

Holly: Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
Michael: Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.

Holly: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Holly: Mm-hmm.

Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!

Michael: Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed.  It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax!

Phyllis: It's the only gavel I could find.
Michael: It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
Darryl: Hey Mike, do my thing.
Michael: Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
Darryl: Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
Jim: 5 dollars.
Darryl: Sold! To Jim.

Pam: If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?
Michael: Even as pie.


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2258]

Michael:  Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections.  Mmm.  Mmm.   I'm the Godfather.  I'm gonna eat this whole pizza.  And then I'm gonna kill you.   some cheese.  You gotta fold it up.  That's the way you eat pizza.


[Date: October 24, 2008, Session #2259]

Michael: I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.
Jim: Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Michael: I have two sure things, one wildcard.

Michael: Okay.
Jim: Mmm-hmm.
Michael: The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
Jim: Uh-oh.
Michael: Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up...

[Date: October 30, 2008, Session #2270]

Oscar:  Isn't it a seven-hour drive?
Holly: It's not that bad. But if I'm really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.
Oscar: I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly.  You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....

Michael:  This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
Darryl:  I'm driving them up for five times what I would've made at work. I thought I made a good deal.  Then I realized I'm gonna be trapped in a truck with Mike all day.

Michael: The man has a point.
Holly: Darryl....
Darryl: All right, I made it up.
Michael:  What? Why?
Darryl: Because I wanted you to like me.
Michael:  I do! Hey, come on!

Holly: You are.
Michael: No, you are.
Holly: You are more.
Darryl: 
Michael: You're the best.
Holly: You're better.
Michael: You're better. You're better than my best.
Holly: You're better than betterest.
Holly: 
Michael: Here we go.
Holly: Hold your breath!
Michael: Okay, Ready?
Darryl:  Go.
Michael & Holly: 
Darryl:  At least it's quiet.
Michael: Watch this. Darryl, watch this.
Holly: Look, Darryl, lip up.
Michael & Holly: 
Holly: Down, and give me 50!
Michael & Holly:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Darryl: Hey, you know what would be fun? Like, sleeping.
Michael: Yeah
Darryl: You know.
Holly:  Oh, snuggles!
Michael: Yeah. Right, snuggle time.
Holly: Snuggles.
Darryl: There you go.
Michael: 
Holly: Spooning.


[Date: October 30, 2008, Session #2280]

Michael: Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
Holly: Mmm hmm.
Michael: We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.
Holly: Ooh!
Michael: Speak.
Holly: We could stay in a cozy B&B with a fireplace?
Michael: Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.
Darryl: Oh, thanks. Thanks. No.
Michael: Come on, it'll be fun.
Darryl: Thank you. Thank you. No.


[Date: October 30, 2008, Session #2281]

Michael:  Hey, look at that. Fun, right?
Holly: Mmm.
Michael: Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: Say what you said.
Holly: No, Michael. I don't.... I'm gonna puke!
Michael:  I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman!
Holly: Darryl didn't want any?
Michael: I didn't ask.


[Date: October 30, 2008, Session #2282]

Michael: We want the same things.
Holly: I know, but from seven hours away.
Michael: That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Holly: Michael....
Michael: Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.
Darryl: Hey, y'all wanna hear some loud music or something?
Holly: I'm an atheist. Did you know that? I don't know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven't even had yet.
Darryl: Hey, look, Pennsylvania license plate! That's crazy! All the way out here! Who can name all the states?


[Date: October 30, 2008, Session #2283]

Michael:  Oh, it's really cold here.
Holly: Oh, it's just later.
Michael: Yeah.
Darryl:  Here we go.
Michael:  Can we have another? I think I blinked.


[Date: October 30, 2008, Session #2284]

Holly:  This is me here.
Michael: Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.
Darryl: Stairs. Oh, man....


[Date: November 6, 2008, Session #2285]

Michael: Hey, sport.
Dwight: I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? 
Michael: Ow! God!
Dwight: Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!


[Date: November 6, 2008, Session #2286]

Andy: Big idea: double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
Michael: No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
Jim: Yeah, we'd never do that.
Michael: Yeah, so there you go.
Kelly:  Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
Michael: Oh, wow, so quickly.
Kelly: Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
Kevin: Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
Michael: Nope. Nope. Not yet.
Jim: You wouldn't tell your mom?
Kevin: You love your mom.
Kelly: Call your mom, Michael. 
Michael: I'll call her later.
Group:  Call her! Call her!
Michael: I don't want to do that.  All right.  She is going to freak out!
Andy:  Speakerphone!
Michael: That's -- thanks.
Mother:  Hello?
Michael: Mom, I'm getting married.
Mother: No, you're not.
Michael: Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
Mother: Well, are you getting married?
Michael: No. 
Mother: Are you-- 
Michael: I'm not, I'm not getting married. So...  Psych.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2287]

Kelly: So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
Michael: And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
Kelly: Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there? 
Michael: I'll take care of that for you.  Thanks.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2288]

Michael: Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. 'Schindler's List' parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2289]

Michael: Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
Dwight: Bring it on. 
Michael: No.
Dwight: Sorry.
Michael: Wow.
Dwight: What does it say?
Michael: Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
Dwight: That's impossible.
Michael: A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
Dwight: I sell more paper than anyone. 
Michael: No, no, no, no, no.
Dwight: Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
Michael: Do I look like I am joking?
Dwight: No, but that's sometimes part of it.
Michael: If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
Dwight: Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
Michael: You're not.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2290]

Pam:  What was that?
Jim: Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Pam: Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
Jim: It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Dwight: What are you mumbling about?
Jim: How was your meeting with Michael?
Dwight: None of your business.
Jim: Was it your scores?
Dwight: Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: I'm being sabotaged.
Jim: Of course.
Dwight: And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
Jim: Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Dwight: You're an idiot.
Jim: There's the charm.
Michael: Jimbo, let's do this thang.
Jim: That is me. Wish me luck.
Dwight: No way.
Pam:  Good luck.
Jim: Thanks.
Dwight: I didn't say anything
Pam: I love you.
Jim: I love you, too.
Dwight: What do you think I am saying to you?!
Jim: I'm not talking to you.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2291]

Michael: Oh, come on.
Jim: What?
Michael: You too?
Jim: Did my scores drop a little?
Michael: Jim, they are a poopy. 


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2292]

Jim: Are we even sure that's my file?
Michael: No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
Jim: Well, there's got to be an explanation.
Michael: I agree.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: So let's see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
Jim: I think you mean smug
Michael:  Arrogance.
Jim: Michael, I'm just trying to --
Michael: And there's our smudgeness.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2293]

Michael: Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
Jim: Microgement.
Michael: Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
Dwight: All right, fine.  Brrring.
Jim:  Hello?
Dwight: Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
Jim: Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
Dwight: Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Jim: Wow, this is my lucky day.
Michael:  Ask him his name.
Dwight: What is your name, sir?
Jim: I am Bill Buttlicker.
Dwight: Really, that's your real name?
Jim: How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
Michael: Be respectful, Dwight.
Dwight: Yes, Michael.
Jim: Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
Dwight: What? No, but I --
Jim: Hello?  No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. 
Michael: It's up to you to change his mind.
Jim: Sorry. That was a family emergency.
Dwight: Oh, no. What's wrong?
Jim: You know what? That's private.
Michael: Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
Dwight: Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
Jim: Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
Michael: He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Dwight: OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
Jim: You're gonna have to talk louder.
Dwight: OK, our prices have never been lower.
Jim: Son, you have to talk louder.
Dwight: ...never been lower!
Jim: Louder, son!
Dwight:  Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
Michael: Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight: He --
Michael: That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
Jim: Now, you listen to me, sir.
Michael: Here we go.
Jim: The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
Michael: Give me the phone.
Dwight: Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
Jim: I'm irate right now.
Michael: Give me the phone.
Dwight: Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Michael: Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Dwight: I have to put you on with my boss.
Jim: Well, I should hope so.  Who is this?
Michael: Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
Jim: Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
Michael: Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
Jim: Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Dwight:  Yeah!
Michael:  See how it's done?  Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it.  See what I did?
Dwight: You are the master.
Jim: There is one condition, Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Jim: You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
Dwight: Don't do it, Michael.
Michael: ...  It's a million-dollar sale.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2294]

Kelly: What's going on?
Michael: Why don't you tell us?
Kelly: Nothing's going on.
Dwight: Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Michael: Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
Kelly: What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
Dwight: Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
Jim: We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
Michael: What's going on?
Kelly: I love your tie, Michael.
Michael:  Kelly.
Kelly: I was raped.
Michael: You cannot say 'I was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
Kelly: OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
Dwight: We have our confession. I'm calling security. 
Michael: Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
Kelly: See? I wasn't lying.
Michael: You were lying.
Kelly: I was lying.
Michael: Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
Dwight: I want to be here when you fire her ass.
Michael: I will call you when it is time. 
Michael: I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
Kelly: No problem.
Michael: I think you should do that. 


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2295]

Meredith: Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
Michael: How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.
Kevin & Andy: Ooooh.
Michael: And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.
Jim: Perfect.
Michael: The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'Opa!' Which means 'congratulations,' so...
Andy: Oh, man!


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2296]

Pam:  Ask how he's doing since the breakup.
Jim: So, how you holdin' up?
Michael: I'm pretty much devastated.
Pam: Ask if there's anything you can do.
Jim: You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
Michael: Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.
Pam: Tell him you'd like to go with him.
Jim: We should take a look at those surveys.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2297]

Michael: Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2298]

Michael: Great marks, Phyllis. 
Phyllis:  Hey, I did good too!
Stanley: I knew it. Haha! 
Andy:  Up! Don't leave me hangin'! 


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2299]

Michael: I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.


[Date: November 7, 2008, Session #2300]

Michael: Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute...
Dwight:  Here.
Michael: Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.
Andy: I am no longer the worst salesman in the office. Yes!  Ow! Dammit!


[Date: November 9, 2008, Session #2301]

Michael: Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.
Jim: Why are you telling us this?
Michael: I am jetting off on an international business trip.
Jim: Where are you going?
Michael: To Can-A-da.
Jim: Where is it?
Michael: Canada.
Jim: Okay.


[Date: November 9, 2008, Session #2302]

Michael: My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...


[Date: November 9, 2008, Session #2303]

Michael: Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
Meredith:  Hello.
Michael: I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2304]

David Wallace:  Do you have your passport?
Michael: I have my passport. 
David Wallace: Got your per diem?
Michael: I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
David Wallace: Michael, the... that's for your food.
Michael: Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2305]

Michael: And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
David Wallace: Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
Michael: Well that is all in the past.
David Wallace: And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
Michael: They have one of those?


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2306]

Michael:  Lets do this!
Dwight: Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
Michael: Two are for souvenirs.
Dwight: Do you have your money belt?
Michael: I do. It's right here. 
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. 
Michael: No, I don't want to wear a bra.
Dwight: Here, let me help you. 
Michael: Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight: Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
Michael: Okay.  Where is my translator?
Andy: Monsieur.
Michael: There he is.
Andy: I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation: Goodbye my petite fiancee. 
Angela: Be good.
Andy: I will try.
Angela: Meaning what?
Andy: Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
Michael: Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you  if you hadn't forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
Oscar: Here.
Michael: There we go. Our town car awaits.
Meredith: It's just a van.
Michael: Its not just a van.
Meredith: Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
Michael: Dwight, can you get those please?
Dwight: 


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2307]

Michael:  Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
Andy: Ah... sweet!
Michael: Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
Andy: Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
Michael: Take a sip of that. 
Andy: Mmmhmmm...
Michael: That good?
Andy: Mmmm...
Michael: Don't drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
Andy: That's really good. 
Oscar: I'm good.
Michael: You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
Stewardess: I'm sorry.  You'll need to keep moving.
Michael: Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
Beth: We need to keep the isle clear.
Michael: Yes...
Andy: Oh...
Michael: Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.
Andy: Oh boy. 
Michael:  Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
Oscar:  Andy brought one too.
Andy:  Harry and the Henderson's
Michael: Shhhh! Keep it down.
Oscar: I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? 
Michael: Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
Michael:  Hi.
Beth: Hi.
Michael: Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Beth: Oh, I'm sorry. There are no meals on flights less than two hours.
Michael: Oh... okay.  Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I can't see because I am in a--  GAH!
Beth: What would you like to drink?


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2308]

Michael:  This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah.
Oscar: I'll check us in.
Michael: Alright.
Andy: Very cool.
Michael: Very cool.
Andy: We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
Michael: Okay.
Andy: Where's the concierge?
Michael: Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
Andy: Mmm... bingo!  Follow moi, bro-sieur.
Michael: Wow!
Andy:  What about a nice sushi place?  Maybe a place with a view?
Concierge: Tsk... Oh.  Matsuki.  That's a good one.  Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9:00.  Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there.
Michael: Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
Andy: One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
Concierge: Oh, the Huntsman is good.
Andy:  The Huntsman.
Concierge: Down here... the financial district.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2309]

Michael: A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2310]

Michael: Guys, she's in there.
Andy: Engaging wings 
Oscar: I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
Michael: Let's do this.
Andy: Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
Michael:  Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
Marie: Good to see you.
Michael: Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
Oscar: Nice to meet you. 
Marie: Oscar.
Michael: Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
Oscar: Yes.
Michael: ...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
Marie: Thank you.
Michael: And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
Oscar: Michael, why?
Michael: She's foreign.  I am--
Andy: For Madame et monsieur. 
Michael: Oh, thank you.
Andy: You're welcome.
Michael: Thank you, Andy.
Marie: Thank you?
Andy: Let me get a picture of you guys.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2311]

Michael: Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2312]

Michael: How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
Concierge Marie: Mmm-hmmm...
Michael: ---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Marie: Uh...A stro cleaners on St. Johns place is the only place open on that day.
Michael: Unbelievable! Unbelievable.


[Date: November 10, 2008, Session #2313]

Michael:  Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
Concierge Marie: I am so tired.
Michael: Okay.


[Date: November 17, 2008, Session #2314]

Andy: Oscar
Oscar: Hey.
Andy: That was fun last night.
Oscar: Yeah, it was.
Andy: You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
Oscar: Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
Andy: You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. 
Oscar: I can't believe we called her up. 
Andy: Totally.  What--- Who?
Oscar: I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
Andy: We called Angela?
Oscar: You--- you call--- you called her.
Andy: That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!
Oscar: Alright.
Andy: Oh, God!
Oscar: Okay.
Andy: So bad!
Oscar: Good morning, Michael.   Are you ready for the meeting?
Michael: Slept like a baby.


[Date: November 17, 2008, Session #2315]

Client: I'll be honest with you--- we've been talking with Catalyst Paper. Their prices are better than yours.
Michael: Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. 
Client: Everything okay?
Michael: Yes.


[Date: November 17, 2008, Session #2316]

David Wallace:  Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
Michael: Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
David Wallace: Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
Michael: No. Actually the trip sucked.
David Wallace: Excuse me?
Michael: The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
David Wallace: What are you talking about?
Michael: I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
David Wallace: Okay.
Michael: And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
David Wallace: The hotel? What, M--- okay.
Michael: It was not, it sucked.
David Wallace: I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
Michael: Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---
Dacvid Walalce: Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey.
Michael: That was a really good choice.
David Wallce: Michael, please lets listen for a second.
Michael: No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
Dacvid Wallace: Michael, sometimes---
Michael: That was a really sucky thing to do.
David Wallace: Sometimes, we--

Michael: Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think it's because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  That's respect.

Angela: Are you swallowing them whole?  You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
Kevin:  Yes.
Dwight: Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
Jim: So why did you come in here?
Dwight: To socialize.  And inform.
Michael: Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
Ryan: You're taking two?
Kelly: Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
Michael: Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
Kelly: Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
Michael: Heh, okay, weirdo.
Jim: Why is that, why is that weird?
Michael: She said she was going to give it to him right now. 
Jim:  She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Michael: Yeah, they used to.
Jim: Toby works here again.
Michael: Oh, can you imagine?
Jim: Oh no.
Michael: Uhhgh.
Jim: You don't know.
Michael: I don't know.  What?
Jim: You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
Michael: Hmmm, dare I?   You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.   Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. 
Toby: Hi, Micha-
Michael: NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2319]

Michael:  Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
Dwight: He looks great.
Michael: No.
Dwight: Well rested.
Michael: He looks worse.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2320]

David: Michael, is everyone okay?
Michael: Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
David: I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
Michael: Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
David: Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
Michael: Yes.
David: All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2321]

Michael: I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2322]

David: Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Michael: I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Dwight: Also, it's icky back there.
Michael: That's true.  People say it's icky.
David: Okay, I have to go.
Michael: David, wait.
David: No.
Michael: Is there no way we can get rid of him?
David: Not without cause, Michael.
Michael: I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
David: You have to get along with Toby.
Michael: No.
David: Yep.
Michael: I don't.
David: Goodbye, Michael. 
Michael:  Don't do that.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2323]

Michael: You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served.  Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
Toby: Well thanks Michael.
Michael: You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Toby: Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
Michael: So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
Toby: Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine...
Michael: Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
Toby: ...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
Michael: Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?
Toby: It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
Michael: I bet, for you.
Toby: And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
Michael:  Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
Toby: Are you all right, Michael?
Michael: Yeah, I am.  I am.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2324]

Michael: I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like I'm dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2325]

Michael: Okay, just summarize.
Dwight: Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
Michael: That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
Dwight: I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
Michael: Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.
Dwight: Okay 
Michael: What are you doing?
Dwight:  I am the bait.
Michael: For what?
Dwight: Men find me desirable.
Michael: No, no, no.
Dwight: Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
Michael: You're the bait for Toby?
Dwight: Mmhmm.
Michael: No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
Dwight: Men find me desirable.
Michael: Yes, sure they do, Dwight.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2326]

Pam: When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.
Jim: Mmhmm, yeah.
Pam:  Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
Jim: Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
Pam: Are you inching away from me?
Jim: No.
Pam: Reach your arms out.
Jim:  I'm always this close.
Michael: Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Jim: Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
Michael: Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Pam: What do you need, Michael?
Michael: Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
Michael: Good.  N-no no no, don't.
Pam: Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'
Michael: Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2327]

Ryan:  You did that for me?
Kelly: Mmhmm.
Ryan: Are you happy you did?
Toby: Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
Ryan:   What's up?
Michael: Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
Ryan: Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
Michael: Toby can I see those? Ooh.  What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?
Dwight: Those are fighting words.
Michael: You mad? You mad at me?
Dwight: I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
Michael: Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
Dwight: Hmmm?
Michael: Huh?  He might do it...
Kelly: Punch him, Toby!
Michael: I dare you to.  Come on.
Dwight: Come on.  Baaah!
Michael: What's the matter... haaaww!
Dwight: Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
Ryan: Yeah, punch him.
Michael: Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
Dwight: Ryan.  Come on, man?
Michael: No do it, do it.  I dare you.
Dwight: Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Michael: Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
Toby: I'm not going to punch you, Michael.
Dwight: Are you really not going to punch him?
Toby: No, why would I punch you?
Michael: Son of a bitch.
Ryan:  You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2328]

Dwight: I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Michael:  Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day.
Dwight: There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Michael: What's that?
Dwight:  Frame him, for using drugs.
Michael: Frame him?
Dwight: Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Michael: I've never framed a man before, have you?
Dwight: Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Michael: Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2329]

Michael: Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?   Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.
Vance Refrigeration guy: A fridge?
Michael: No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
Vance Refrigeration guy: What?
Michael: Grass, weed?
Leo: What makes you think we'd have weed?
Michael: I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
Vance Refrigeration Guy:  Hey, just hold on one second.
Michael: I'm not wearing a wire, so...
Leo: Why would you even say that?
Vance Refrigeration Guy:  Hey, that's gonna be 500 dollars.
Michael: How much? How many pounds is it?
Vance Refrigeration Guy: It's- it's two pounds.  I'm losing money on this man just, give me the money.  Alright, walk away.
Leo: Walk away.
Vance Refrigeration Guy: Walk away.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2330]

Kelly: Hi, Michael.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2331]

Michael: Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what's going on. 
Dwight: Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Toby: Hey, what is this?
Dwight: Search his things.
Police Officer 2: Sir, can you step away from your desk please?
Toby: Why?
Police Officer 2: Sir, please step away from your desk.
Toby: Hey, what's going on?  You don't have my permission to do this.
Dwight: They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Toby: Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
Michael: Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
Toby: Don't search my stuff.
Police Officer 1: Sir?
Toby: I have a reasonable right to privacy.
Dwight: Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Toby: Michael!
Michael: Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?
Police Officer 1: Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?
Toby: Oh my God!
Michael: No, no no no... No, no.
Toby: That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?
Michael: No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
Police Officer 1: Really?
Police Officer 2: Check this out.
Michael: Oh God!
Toby: That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.
Michael: No, no no no no.
Police Officer 1: Turn around.
Toby: What is going on here?
Michael: God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
Police Officer 1: Do you have any weapons?
Toby: Of course not!
Michael: Ahh, that's mine.
Dwight: No! Michael, no!
Michael: Yes, it's mine.
Police Officer 2: Some basil.  Salad dressing, I think.
Police Officer 1: Salad dressing?
Police Officer 2: Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad.  There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.
Michael: Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.
Dwight: So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
Police Officer 2: No.
Dwight: Gahh, dammit!  Come on!
Police Officer 1: We got a fake tip.
Dwight: Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Police Officer 1: No.
Dwight:  You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
Michael: You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
Toby: I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
Michael: Hmm.
Toby: Did you?
Michael: Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
Toby: You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
Michael: Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.


[Date: November 20, 2008, Session #2332]

Michael: You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
Toby: I did leave.
Michael: Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
Toby: Well, I don't see it that way.
Michael: Do you want to hear a lie?
Toby: What?
Michael: I think you're great.  You're my best friend.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2333]

Oscar: Here are our final actual costs for this year.
Michael: Mmm... okay.
Oscar: As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
Michael: Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
Oscar: Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Michael: Yes.
Oscar: Right there.
Michael: There's the x-ax...icks.
Oscar: You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
Michael: Mmhmm, okay.
Oscar: But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Michael: Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
Oscar: Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
Michael: Ho-oh!
Oscar: So you have an extra dollar.
Michael: Yeah.
Oscar: So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Michael: I'll be six.
Oscar: And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
Michael: So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
Oscar: We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
Michael:  Whoo.
Oscar: We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
Michael: Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2334]

Michael: Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  Can anybody guess?
Pam: New chairs?
Michael: No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
Oscar: No, no, please. Please do not do this.
Pam: Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
Michael: So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
Pam:  Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
Oscar: Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
Pam: Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
Oscar: Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
Pam: Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
Michael: Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
Stanley: I'm with Pam. Chairs.
Michael: Alright, so, teams forming.
Toby: We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
Michael: You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Toby: You'll see.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Pam: I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
Jim: Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
Pam: What? Jim.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2335]

Meredith: Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
Creed: The balls on you, man.
Oscar: So Michael, what do you think?
Michael: Why me?
Jim: You have to make the decision.
Michael: Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2336]

Pam: Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
Michael: Yes.
Pam: Well that never happened.
Oscar: Michael?
Michael: I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oscar: I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Michael: Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
Jim: Woah, you guys going to lunch?
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Mind if I join?
Michael: Ohh, God!
Jim: All right.
Michael: Yeah!
Jim: Let's go.
Michael: Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jim: Let's do it.
Michael: All right! Cool!
Jim: Where we going?
Michael: I have no idea.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2337]

Oscar:  Stop it! Michael.
Jim: Michael, that is hilarious.
Michael:  Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
Oscar: The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. 
Jim: Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Pam: Aww.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: That's cool.  Mm, good stuff. 
Jim: You look really pretty.
Pam: Thank you. 
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: Hey!
Michael: Oh, hey.
Pam: You got a second?
Michael: I do.
Pam: Oh, good.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2338]

Pam: Oh, that must've been so fun.
Michael: it was fun. We had a good time.
Pam: Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
Michael: Oh, thank you.
Pam: Yeah, is that a new tie?
Michael: Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
Pam: That is amazing!
Michael: You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Pam: What?
Michael: Nine dollars. The boys' department.
Pam: No.
Michael: Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
Pam:  No way!
Michael: Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
Pam: Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
Michael: Yes they were.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: They were.
Pam: Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...
Michael: Mmhmm.
Pam: But not everyone...
Michael: Sits on a copier.
Pam: Or even uses the copier every day.
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: Yeah, right?
Michael: Very valid.
Pam: ...That's it. 
Michael: All right.
Pam: All right, see you later...
Michael: See ya.
Pam: Hot tie guy.
Michael:  Hahaha!... well...


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2339]

Michael: Okay.
Kevin: Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
Michael: Oh, thank you my dear.
Kelly: Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
Michael: Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
Stanley: There he is!
Michael: There he is! Hello, hello!
Phyllis: Hello.
Michael: Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Jim: Oh!
Michael: Mm!  Yeah!
Pam: There's that ass!
Michael: Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
Pam: Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!
Michael: Oh... ah, I almost choked.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2340]

Hank: Got a call about a problem up here.
Pam: Did somebody call Hank?
Michael: Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
Hank: So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
Michael: Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
Hank: Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.
Michael: Yes.
Hank: So what are we talking about?
Michael: Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Hank: I know what a surplus is.
Michael: Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
Hank: Is that the copier?
Michael: It is, yes.
Hank:  Hmm.
Michael: What?
Hank: I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
Michael: Okay.
Pam: You can try mine.
Michael: Oh, there we go.
Hank: Hmm, not much lumbar support.
Michael: Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
Hank: On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
Michael: So, the copier.
Hank: Well, let me finish.
Michael: All right, yes.
Hank: Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
Michael: Well, what should I do?
Hank: ...Let me see the copier again.
Michael: All right, get out. Get out.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2341]

David:  Michael.
Michael: Hey David-  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
David: Is this why you're calling me?
Michael: No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling-  I'm sorry.
David: Okay.
Michael: Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
David: You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Michael: No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
David: Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Michael: The what now?
David: Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
Michael: ...Like a tip?  $645?!


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2342]

Michael: I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2343]

Jim:  We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
Michael: All right, attention everyone.
Jim: Let me call you right back. Okay.
Michael: I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
Oscar: That's the original.
Michael: Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?   They don't have copiers. They don't even-  Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
Oscar: Do you know?
Michael: Do I know what?
Oscar: I think you know.
Michael: Mm, no...
Phyllis: Know what?
Pam: Yeah, know what?
Oscar: Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
Michael: $645.00
Kevin: Michael's a genius.
Michael: Right.
Oscar: Why'd you say dollars?
Michael: Because that is how my mind works.
Oscar: What's 15% of 200?  Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
Jim: Wait, what?
Pam: You can do that?
Kevin: Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
Michael: Let's see...
Pam: You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
Michael: I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
Oscar: You're gonna get us a copier then?
Michael: This is so stupid.
Pam: Or chairs?
Michael: This is so, so stupid. And, God...  that's my phone.
Stanley: I didn't hear a phone.
Michael: To be continued!


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2344]

Michael: No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2345]

Pam: So what's it gonna be?
Oscar: Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
Pam: Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
Oscar: You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
Michael:  You think it's easy?
Stanley: It's your job.
Michael: Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?


[Date: December 4, 2008, Session #2346]

Michael: It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just-  Hey.
Pam: Hey.
Oscar: Hey, we're going with the chairs.
Michael: What?
Oscar: I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
