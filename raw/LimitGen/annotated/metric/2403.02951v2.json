    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool in advancing the Text-to-SQL task, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Nevertheless, as a nascent research field, there is still no consensus on the optimal prompt templates and design frameworks. Additionally, existing benchmarks inadequately explore the performance of LLMs across the various sub-tasks of the Text-to-SQL process, which hinders the assessment of LLMs’ cognitive capabilities and the optimization of LLM-based solutions. To address the aforementioned issues, we firstly construct a new dataset designed to mitigate the risk of overfitting in LLMs. Then we formulate five evaluation tasks to comprehensively assess the performance of diverse methods across various LLMs throughout the Text-to-SQL process. Our study highlights the performance disparities among LLMs and proposes optimal in-context learning solutions tailored to each task. These findings offer valuable insights for facilitating the development of LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems.",

(2017  ###reference_b52###); Lyu et al. (2020  ###reference_b29###). These methods can be essentially divided into non-seq2seq and seq2seq methods according to their network architecture. In non-seq2seq methods, representative works Wang et al. (2019  ###reference_b46###); Cao et al. (2021  ###reference_b2###); Cai et al. (2021  ###reference_b1###); Hui et al. (2022  ###reference_b15###) typically employ a relation-aware self-attention mechanism as encoder to learn representations of questions and schemas, and then use a grammar-based decoder to generate the SQL as an abstract syntax tree Yin and Neubig (2017  ###reference_b54###), or utilize a sketch-based decoder to obtain the SQL via slot-filling Dong and Lapata (2018  ###reference_b8###); Hwang et al. (2019  ###reference_b16###); Choi et al. (2021  ###reference_b5###). These methods can further benefit from leveraging pre-trained language models like BERT and its extensions Devlin et al. (2018  ###reference_b7###); Liu et al. (2019  ###reference_b28###); Yin et al. (2020  ###reference_b55###) for input embedding initialization. As another line of research, seq2seq methods Raffel et al. (2020  ###reference_b36###); Lin et al. (2020  ###reference_b26###); Qi et al. (2022  ###reference_b34###); Li et al. (2023c  ###reference_b23###) directly translate NL questions into SQL queries through transformer-based Vaswani et al. (2017  ###reference_b45###) architectures in an end-to-end manner. These methods obtain competitive performance by fine-tuning rather than training from scratch, with less effort. They typically use smarter decoding techniques (e.g., constraining the predictions of the decoder Scholak et al. (2021  ###reference_b39###), or schema-aware denoising Xu et al. (2021  ###reference_b50###)) to prevent the production of invalid SQLs. RESDSQL Li et al. (2023a  ###reference_b21###) further decouples the intertwined process of schema linking (determining the schema items like tables and columns in a SQL) and skeleton parsing (determining the SQL keywords), which alleviates the difficulty of Text-to-SQL. Apart from network architectures, the paradigms employed by these methods vary greatly in terms of input encoding, output decoding, neural training, output refinement, making Text-to-SQL a flourishing research area Katsogiannis-Meimarakis and Koutrika (2023  ###reference_b17###)."

Given the powerful zero-shot reasoning and domain generalization abilities of LLMs, these methods successively refresh the record on the cross-domain Spider leaderboard. Din-SQL Pourreza and Rafiei (2024) proposes decomposing the Text-to-SQL task into smaller sub-tasks effectively. DAIL-SQL Gao et al. (2023) explores how to select the most helpful example and organize them properly in prompts in a few-shot scenario. Similarly, other studies investigate the selection of few-shot demonstrations by synthesizing in-domain examples Chang and Fosler-Lussier (2023) and retrieving question skeletons Guo et al. (2023). MAC-SQL Wang et al. (2023a) utilizes multi-agent collaboration for Text-to-SQL tasks. Several other studies focus on special yet non-trivial scenarios, aiming to expand the scope of the Text-to-SQL task. DBCopilot Wang et al. (2023b) considers a more realistic problem, wherein it deals with large-scale schemas, characterized by massive databases and a large number of tables. It proposes the use of a lightweight seq2seq copilot model for schema-routing, increasing scalability in comparison to traditional schema-linking. ACT-SQL Zhang et al. (2023b) designs a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt to improve the reasoning ability when generating SQLs, and extends to the multi-turn Text-to-SQL task Li et al. (2023b). In summary, these methods primarily focus on improving the performance of the overall Text-to-SQL task through several aspects of the sub-tasks. However, these methods 1) do not individually and systematically study the performance of sub-tasks, and 2) typically rely on experiments using only OpenAI LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT4, etc.), without verifying the robustness of their approaches when applied to other open-source LLMs."

            "text": "WikiSQL Zhong et al. (2017) is considered the first large-scale dataset enabling the training and evaluation of learning-based Text-to-SQL methods, as well as offering a standardized benchmark for straightforward comparison across various methods. It is also known as a cross-domain dataset, featuring over 25,000 tables and 80,000 question-SQL pairs comprising various domains derived from Wikipedia. However, the SQL queries in WikiSQL exhibit low complexity.\n\nSubsequently, most of the recent Text-to-SQL works are done on Spider Yu et al. (2018) because it is widely acknowledged as the most challenging cross-domain benchmark. It comprises 10,181 queries covering 138 different domains, involves multi-table queries (embodied by JOIN), complex SQL clauses (ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING, etc.) and nested SQLs. Several variants of Spider have been designed to evaluate the adaptability of Text-to-SQL methods Shaw et al. (2020); Gan et al. (2022). Spider-Realistic Deng et al. (2020) removes the explicit mention of column names in the NL questions while keeping the SQL queries unchanged, which is more aligned with the use-case of Text-to-SQL in practice. Spider-Syn Gan et al. (2021a) replaces some schema words in the NL question with their synonyms that reflect real-world question paraphrases. Eliminating such explicit correspondence between NL questions and table schemas poses a greater challenge of Text-to-SQL methods. Spider-DK Gan et al. (2021b) integrates artificial domain knowledge, aiming to investigate the robustness of text-to-SQL models when the questions require rarely observed domain knowledge.\n\nGiven that Spider is specifically designed for benchmarking Text-to-SQL methods while diverging from practical scenarios, KaggleDBQA Lee et al. (2021) constructs a small-scale cross-domain dataset from Kaggle, highlighting the diversity of actual web-sourced databases. It comprises knowledge such as documentation and metadata of databases, raising a question of how this extra information could be used to improve the performance.\n\nThe newest seminal benchmark is BIRD Li et al. (2024), involving 12,751 Text-to-SQL pairs and 95 databases with a size of 33.4 GB. It incorporates the advantages of previous datasets, such as Spider (which is cross-domain with complex SQLs) and KaggleDBQA (which requires the ability to use external knowledge evidence). It is the first to be curated for evaluating SQL execution efficiency in large-scale databases, thereby further bridging the gap between academic setups and real-world applications. In this paper, we construct a novel dataset built upon BIRD and use it in the evaluation (see Section 3.3).\n\nTwo primary evaluation metrics for assessing the accuracy of SQLs on Spider are Exact Matching(EM) and Execution Accuracy(EX). EM measures whether the predicted query as a whole is equivalent to the gold query. It is possible to encounter false negative evaluations since a question might be solvable by multiple syntactically different but semantically identical SQL statements.\n\nAdditionally, BIRD further proposes Valid Efficiency Score (VES), an integrated metric assessing both accuracy of execution results and the execution efficiency of SQL queries. To increase the VES, methods are required to enhance both execution accuracy and efficiency of SQL queries. We use this metric to assess the SQL optimization in Section 4.3. Refer to Appendix C.1 for detailed definitions of evaluation metrics."

Specifically, on the Spider dataset, Codellama-34B outperforms InternLM-70B and SQLCoder-34B, while on the Bird dataset, SQLCoder-34B surpasses InternLM-70B and Codellama-34B.\n\nThere may be differences in the problem types that different LLMs excel at handling. Considering that LLMs learn and train from large corpora, these findings suggest that the performance discrepancies observed could be attributed to the potential utilization of open-source datasets during the fine-tuning process for coding-specific LLMs. This poses challenges in ensuring the reliability of evaluation results obtained on these datasets.\n\nTo address the potential overfitting of LLMs, particularly those specialized in coding tasks, and to ensure a reliable and accurate assessment of their capabilities, we construct a novel dataset, termed “BigTable-0.2k”. This dataset is an extension and augmentation of the BIRD dataset, which is a recently released and widely acknowledged benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL parsing.\n\nSpecifically, our construction process involves a systematic analysis of the original BIRD dataset, identifying queries of varying difficulty levels and involving different numbers of tables (1, 2, 3, and more than 3). We modify and expand these queries by altering table and column names, as well as filtering conditions, to create a more diverse set of challenges. In cases where the original dataset lacks sufficient examples with four or more tables (there are only 20 instances in BIRD-Dev dataset), queries that involved three tables are expanded to four. As shown in Table 2, this process generates 50 new instances for each category, resulting in the “BigTable-0.2k” dataset. Moreover, each item in the dataset underwent mutual verification by at least two individuals to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlthough the prevalence of queries involving more than three tables may not align with common real-world applications, this approach allows for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs’ cognitive abilities across a spectrum of sub-tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the “BigTable-0.2k” dataset retains the original BIRD dataset’s attributes, such as its large-scale and complexity, diversity of data sources, cross-domain applicability, and the requirement for external knowledge reasoning. Moreover, we standardize the dataset format to align with other benchmarks, by combining user NL questions with external knowledge to form new, contextually rich questions."

However, these representations lack uniformity in their structure, making it difficult to find out how a specific feature within a prompt template impacts performance. \n\nTo address this issue, we investigate a more unified series of prompt templates. As shown in various listings, these templates differ across three features:\n\n1. **DDL/SimpleDDL prefix**: Affects the representation of the database schema.\n   - “DDL” (Data Definition Language) encompasses the standardized language that includes commands for defining the structure and properties of a database, providing detailed information necessary for database creation, including column types and primary/foreign keys.\n   - “SimpleDDL” is simplified by only supplying table and column names.\n\n2. **MD/HTML/Coding infix**: Wraps the entire prompt template with Markdown syntax, HTML snippets, and code comment blocks.\n\n3. **Complete/Chat postfix**: Indicates the task of either completing SQL statements based on the \"SELECT\" clause or directly answering questions.\n\nThese features are combined to form a complete prompt template, and more details of these representations can be found in Appendix A.1.\n\nWe test these templates on the Spider dev set. As shown in Table 3, \"SimpleDDL-MD-Chat\" consistently outperforms all other prompts when applied to all 5 backbone LLMs. To this end, we consistently utilize the prompt template \"SimpleDDL-MD-Chat\" throughout the subsequent evaluations in this paper.

The word cloud distribution reveals that “no such column” and Result Error are the primary areas of error concentration for all models. Additionally, more advanced models exhibit a greater proportion of the Result Error. This aligns with expectations, as powerful models are less prone to low-level System Errors.\n\nHowever, the concise nature of the error information in the Result Error category significantly hampers the debugging performance. Therefore, we propose a further detailed classification method.\n\nSpecifically, in addressing the Result Error category, we categorize these errors based on the logical construction of SQL statements. This classification is prioritized according to the logical structure within the SQL query. It is delineated in order into the following five subcategories:\n\nTable Query Error pertains to issues related to the selection of tables in the SQL query. It is further subdivided into three types: Excessive/Missing/Incorrect Tables, which respectively address scenarios where unnecessary tables are included, required tables are omitted, or the wrong tables are referenced.\n\nColumn Selection Error focuses on the appropriateness of column selection. Similar to the Table Query Error, it is broken down into Excessive/Missing/Incorrect Columns.\n\nJoin Columns Error examines the errors associated with JOIN operations.\n\nCondition Filter Error encompasses errors that occur in the conditions used to filter the data, including incorrect comparisons or misapplied filters.\n\nData Processing Error pertains to errors in the data processing stage, which includes aggregations, calculations, etc. applied to the data within the SQL query.\n\nDuring the categorization process, we employ rules to determine the first three error types and utilize LLMs to perform binary classification for the last two error types (see Appendix A.2). The distribution of different subcategories within Result Error is shown in the bottom section of Figure 3."

Add manual annotations for all error information. See Appendix A.2 for a detailed prompt template.\n\nWhat is the most powerful information organization of self-debug?\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, it is evident that the self-debugging performance of LLMs exhibits an upward trend with the introduction of more granular error information. In the absence of additional information, LLM does not possess the capability to regenerate correct answers. However, all models are able to comprehend fine-grained error information, whether it includes comments or not, and rectify their own mistakes. Detailed error information and corresponding annotations greatly enhance the capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to effectively correct errors.\n\nCan an LLM debug the error incurred by other LLMs (general debugging)?\n\nAs depicted in Table 5, we select two representative LLMs, SQLCoder and InternLM, to assess their general debugging capabilities. When debugging erroneous SQL statements generated by other LLMs, additional error information can potentially impair the performance. Conversely, the most naive approach of simply regenerating the SQL statements often yields the best results. This highlights the differences between different LLMs. The debugger LLMs may not encounter errors caused by other LLMs, and these error type informations might confuse them. Consequently, it is unlikely to achieve performance improvement through general debugging. However, the integration of results generated by different LLMs holds promise as a future research direction. The performance of cross-LLM SQL debugging is inferior to the direct regeneration. A multi-agent approach that integrates outputs from different models shows great potential."

Specifically, we devise an extensive suite of prompts  curated to SQL optimization: with : In this basic form, only original SQL statements are provided. w/ : Further incorporates the database schema  and the user question . w/ demo: Introduce few-shot demonstrations without explanations. Demonstrations are intuitively designed, incorporating common optimization rules, such as substituting “COUNT(*)” with “COUNT(<column_name>)”. w/ demo + comments: Add an explanation for the few-shot demonstrations. See Appendix A.3  ###reference_### for a detailed prompt template.\n\nSimpleDDL-MD-Chat-Efficiency: To avoid the accumulation of errors caused by multiple generations, this prompt template requires LLMs to directly generate the most efficient SQL query statement based on user query. The effectiveness of these SQL optimization methods are demonstrated in Table 6  ###reference_###.\n\nAlmost all two-stage methods experience a significant decrease in VES. It can be attributed to the possibility of LLMs optimizing the correct SQL statements into incorrect ones, thereby resulting in a further decrease in accuracy. Even when considering only the correct results, the performance improvement in terms of execution efficiency brought by the optimized SQL statements is almost negligible. Furthermore, it is intriguing to note that directly instructing the LLM to generate efficient SQL statements appears to achieve improved accuracy. This suggests that placing higher demands on the LLM could yield surprisingly positive outcomes. In-context learning methods present challenges in achieving effective SQL optimization with LLMs."

While it seems that SQL-to-Text cannot serve as a sub-task within the Text-to-SQL pipeline to improve the performance of End-to-End Text-to-SQL systems, employing this conversion as a supplementary step within the pipeline can indeed provide valuable insights. By converting the generated SQL statements back into text and juxtaposing these with the semantics of the original user questions, we can assess the accuracy of the SQL statements produced. In addition, it can assist researchers in evaluating the semantic comprehension capabilities of different LLMs, thus facilitating the development of more effective Text-to-SQL methodologies. To this end, we assess the performance of SQL-to-Text across different LLMs (See Appendix A.4  ###reference_### for prompt templates). The selected metrics for evaluation encompass the F1 values of Rouge-1/2/L and BertScore, along with the application of LLM to assess the semantic coherence between the two texts. The evaluation results are depicted in Table 7  ###reference_###. ChatGPT and InternLM2 demonstrate the highest performance, followed by InternLM, while Codellama and SQLCoder exhibit comparatively lower performance. This highlights that even in regards to semantic description of code, general-purpose models exhibit significantly stronger descriptive capabilities compared to coding-specific models. Utilizing a general-purpose model for semantic description of SQL statements is a better choice."

It involves aligning entity references in the question with the corresponding schema tables or columns, requiring the model to understand both structure and value of the database, as well as the semantics of user questions. In LLM-based Text-to-SQL, prior studies Dong et al. (2023 ###reference_b9###); Pourreza and Rafiei (2024 ###reference_b33###) design prompt instructions with in-context learning examples to enable LLMs to retrieve linked tables and columns, which are then used for the downstream Text-to-SQL task. However, none of these methods individually evaluate the performance of schema linking, and explicit evaluation metrics have yet to be established. Moreover, despite considerable advancements in semantic comprehension and generalization brought by LLMs, the performance of schema linking is still far from promising. In this section, we aim to bridge these gaps by: (1) introducing elaborately designed metrics to assess schema linking methods, (2) presenting a novel schema linking method “PreSQL”, which demonstrates superior performance, (3) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a range of schema linking methods across various LLMs."

            "text": "What schema linking method is considered good? A straightforward goal of schema linking is that the GT tables should be retrieved as much as possible. However, due to the ambiguity inherent in natural language and the potential semantic similarities between candidate tables, retrieving more GT tables typically comes at the cost of a higher redundancy, known as the precision-recall trade-off. Therefore, the objective of schema linking is to retrieve all GT tables while avoiding the retrieval of excessive tables (with minimal redundancy).\n\nTo evaluate this, we design a comprehensive metric called Retrieval Efficiency Score (RES), defined as:\nwhere  and  denote the set of GT tables and retrieved tables for the -th instance, respectively,  refers to the scale of a set.\n\nWe emphasize that the RES serves as a more appropriate metric for evaluating schema linking than the F1-score. This is because it aligns the principle that recalling all GT tables is more important than increasing the precision of retrieval, as the former constitutes a prerequisite for generating correct SQL queries."

            "text": "The methods we evaluated are as follows (see Appendix A.5 for the full prompt of these methods):\n\nZero Shot: A schema linking prompt proposed in C3 Dong et al. (2023), which instructs the LLM to rank all the tables from relevant to irrelevant in a zero-shot manner.\n\nFew Shot: Instructing the LLM to retrieve only the most important tables with few-shot demonstration, presented in DIN-SQL Pourreza and Rafiei (2024).\n\nPreSQL: First, we employ the zero-shot Text-to-SQL described in Section 4.1 to generate a preliminary SQL query. From this preliminary SQL, table and column entities are parsed to serve as the retrieval results for schema linking.\n\nFew Shot + PreSQL: This approach takes the union of the retrieval results from both the Few Shot and PreSQL methods, aiming to leverage the strengths of each.\n\nNote that we organize the information of the database schema in a way similar to \"SimpleDDL-\" in the prompt of all the methods mentioned above, which ignores the information about foreign keys. However, as argued in Wang et al. (2019), foreign keys embody features of known schema relations and provide important clues for understanding the database structure. To this end, we conduct experiments under both settings, w/ and w/o foreign keys, to investigate how incorporating foreign keys in the prompt influences the performance of schema linking. Results are demonstrated in Table 8 (refer to Appendix B for results on detailed metrics like Exact Match & Subset Match).\n\nIt can be seen that code-specific models excel in performance when utilizing the PreSQL approach, whereas general-purpose models yield optimal results through the Few-Shot + PreSQL method. This aligns with our expectations, as these two types of models excel in coding tasks (see Section 4.1) and semantic understanding tasks (see Section 4.4), respectively.\n\nCan foreign key information facilitate schema linking? The introduction of foreign key information yields improved performance across all methods and all LLMs. This is evident since a valid JOIN operation in SQL queries is typically based on foreign keys. The foreign key information helps the model retrieve more ground truth tables by indicating all potential table pairs involved in a JOIN operation. Foreign key information is capable of advancing the performance of schema linking. PreSQL yields the highest performance on coding-specific models, and integrating the results from Few Shot can further enhance performance on general-purpose models."

The results of the study demonstrate notable performance variations across the LLMs, underscoring the significance of careful model selection and prompt engineering in attaining optimal outcomes in text-to-SQL tasks. Our benchmarking provides a meticulous perspective on the pipeline, equipping the research community with strategies to improve the semantic understanding and computational performance of LLMs. This advancement contributes to the development of more reliable Text-to-SQL systems."
