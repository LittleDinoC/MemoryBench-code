    "title": "Prompt Mining for Language-based Human Mobility Forecasting",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models, language-based forecasting has recently emerged as an innovative approach for predicting human mobility patterns. The core idea is to use prompts to transform the raw mobility data given as numerical values into natural language sentences so that the language models can be leveraged to generate the description for future observations. However, previous studies have only employed fixed and manually designed templates to transform numerical values into sentences. Since the forecasting performance of language models heavily relies on prompts, using fixed templates for prompting may limit the forecasting capability of language models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for prompt mining in language-based mobility forecasting, aiming to explore diverse prompt design strategies. Specifically, the framework includes a prompt generation stage and a prompt refinement stage to integrate mechanisms such as the chain of thought. Experimental results on real-world large-scale data demonstrate the superiority of generated prompts from our prompt mining pipeline. Additionally, the comparison of different prompt variants shows that the proposed prompt refinement process is effective. Our study presents a promising direction for further advancing language-based mobility forecasting.",

            "text": "The forecasting of human mobility plays a crucial role in various domains, including urban planning, transportation management, public health preparedness, and disaster response. Accurate predictions of movement patterns and trends can facilitate better location-based services, proactive decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall societal resilience. Traditional statistical forecasting methods often rely on numerical models, but they might fall short in capturing the complex human behavior in real-world scenarios. In an effort to capture these complex patterns, more advanced deep learning forecasting methods, particularly Transformer-based approaches, have emerged. However, these methods often require very complicated model architectures. Recently, language-based forecasting approaches have demonstrated another line of work and emerged as a promising alternative, harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP), language generation frameworks, and advanced pre-trained language models to generate forecasts. These methods present a new paradigm for forecasting human mobility. By transforming numerical data into natural language sentences, these methods make it possible to use existing available language models to comprehend and predict human mobility patterns. This shift towards language-based forecasting has opened up new avenues for enhancing predictive capabilities. Language models, such as Bert and its successors, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating human language. Leveraging their capabilities for mobility forecasting offers the potential to achieve accurate predictions while also reducing the need of designing complex specific forecasting models. \n\nHowever, a key challenge in language-based mobility forecasting lies in the design of effective prompts, that is, how to transform the numerical mobility data and associated auxiliary information into sentences for language models. These prompts serve as the bridge between raw numerical data and natural language descriptions, shaping how well language models can capture the underlying mobility patterns. Generally, different prompts can lead to varying language generation performance, consequently impacting the accuracy of the forecasting. Taking ChatGPT as an example, even for the same topic, using different prompts as inputs will largely result in different responses. Hence, although using fixed manually designed templates for prompt generation as in existing work is simple and straightforward, inadequate prompt template exploration can lead to inaccurate forecasts.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel prompt mining framework for the language-based mobility forecasting task. Our framework is a multi-stage pipeline with prompt initialization, prompt generation, and prompt refinement stages. The prompt refinement stage aims to enhance the generated prompts through a series of sophisticated mechanisms including noise reduction, integration of a chain of thought, and the application of information gain-based temporal segmentation on mobility data. These strategies collectively contribute to generating more refined and contextually relevant prompts. Through extensive experiments with real-world large-scale mobility data, we show the effectiveness of our prompt mining approach. Our results showcase the superiority of generated prompts compared to traditional fixed templates.\n\nIn summary, our work has three main contributions: We propose a novel prompt mining framework that addresses the limitations of relying on fixed templates in existing methods. The chain of thought consideration is also integrated into the prompt mining pipeline. In our framework, the concept of information entropy is explored in both the semantics of the prompt in the prompt generation stage as well as the distribution of the mobility data in the prompt refinement stage. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world mobility data to empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our mined prompt variants show good performance under the language-based mobility forecasting setting."

            "text": "Human mobility forecasting is often conceptualized as a special case within the broader scope of general time series forecasting. Consequently, methodologies developed for general time series forecasting are frequently applied to this domain. Modern time series forecasting techniques heavily rely on deep learning, primarily utilizing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Examples within this RNN-based framework for predicting sequential human behavior include ST-RNN and DeepMove. Motivated by the recent success of applying Transformer architecture in modeling natural language sequences, it has also been applied for human mobility forecasting and general time series forecasting tasks. These methodologies, whether based on RNNs or advanced Transformer architectures, typically adopt a sequence-to-sequence approach, where historical numerical observations form the input sequence to predict future outcomes. As the need to incorporate semantic information (e.g., a POI is a restaurant or a shop) arises to further improve forecasting performance, the complexity of model architectures tends to increase."

            "text": "Efforts to integrate semantic information more directly and effectively have led to the introduction of shaping mobility forecasting as a language generation problem. Xue et al. (2022a) introduced this approach, utilizing natural language sentences to describe historical observations and prediction targets, thereby transforming the forecasting task into a language generation format. Building upon this framework, Xue et al. (2022b) leverage language foundation models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) as the backbone network of the language generation part to conduct human mobility tasks. The recent work by Xue and Salim (2023) further introduced the concept of PromptCast that extended language-based forecasting to other time series data domains like energy and temperature forecasting. However, the prompts used to describe time series are still based on fixed heuristic templates. In this paper, we hypothesize that the performance of language-based forecasting is related to the ways of using language sentences to describe numerical data. Unlike prior studies that have focused narrowly on fixed templates for prompting, our work aims to address this gap by exploring methods to develop more effective prompts, thereby potentially enhancing the performance of the language-based forecasting paradigm."

Given the historical customer visit records of a Point of Interest (POI) over a span of consecutive days, represented as , the objective is to predict the number of visits for the subsequent day.\n\nNormally, different types of auxiliary information such as the area region information, the semantic information, the opening information (e.g., business opening time and ending time), or fine-grained hourly visits are often available, which can be used to assist the forecasting.\n\nTemplate and Prompt: To leverage language models for the forecasting purpose, existing methods employ a predefined prompting template P to convert the numerical data into sentences (these sentences are referred to as prompts) that can be directly processed by language models. The template consists of placeholders for the actual values from the data, resulting in sentences that present the mobility information in a human-readable format. Specifically, the template consists of two essential parts: the history prompt template that describes the historical values as the input sentences of the language models and the future prompt template that defines the sentences for the description of future observations.\n\nIn this study, we focus on the design of P (especially the input parts of language models) and aim to explore diverse prompts that are contextually relevant, coherent, and effective in guiding language models to produce accurate forecasts. Through the investigation of prompts, we seek to enhance the overall forecasting accuracy and reliability of the language-based human mobility forecasting approach."

At this stage, we set the groundwork by creating a diverse pool of potential prompt templates manually. These templates can be used as supervision signals to mentor the following generation stage.\n\nPrompt Generation: In the prompt generation phase, we employ a language model as the core engine to learn how to generate “better” prompts. An evaluator module is specifically designed to indicate the quality of generated prompts in the training process.\n\nPrompt Refinement: The final stage of our framework is prompt refinement. We introduce several mechanisms to further improve the quality of generated prompts from the previous generation step.\n\nBy combining these three stages, our prompt mining framework ensures the systematic evolution of prompts from their initial conception to refined and optimized forms.\n\nThe following subsections delve into each stage of the framework, providing comprehensive insights into the proposed methodology for providing better and more dynamic prompts for the language-based forecasting process."

The initial prompts serve as the foundation upon which subsequent iterations build, which also ensures the generated natural language has a certain directionality.\n\nIn a nutshell, the overarching objective of prompt mining is to use a designated language model to automatically generate prompts from the original raw data, which is typically presented in numerical format. However, as the first attempt, the absence of well-established datasets containing diverse prompts for human mobility data, along with a lack of relevant pre-trained language models for mobility prompt generation, poses a unique challenge.\n\nGiven these considerations, we introduce a pragmatic approach. Instead of directly generating prompts from the raw numerical mobility data, we propose to leverage the fixed template (referred to as the initial template) used in previous work as the input of the prompt generation model and is trained to yield better prompts from the initially given input throughout the prompt mining process."

To effectively train the model \\(M\\), a collection of pseudo labels is essential to supervise the training process. To this end, we establish a pool of templates, as detailed in Appendix A, Table 6. These templates are crafted based on simple heuristics; for instance, Complex templates encompass more detailed information such as specific Points of Interest (POI) details and POI working hours, whereas lower quality templates are more simplistic. The pool consists of 12 lower quality templates and 6 Complex templates. These templates support two main purposes: firstly, they are employed to train a classifier (refer to Section 3.4.1) capable of screening the quality (whether high or low) of a given prompt in the later prompt generation stage; secondly, they serve as pseudo labels during the training of \\(M\\).\n\nIt is worth noting that despite the discrepancy in the number of Simple and Complex templates, the generated training Simple and Complex prompts instances are equivalent in number and balanced. Importantly, during the training process of \\(M\\), these heuristic templates are utilized only as pseudo labels and not as ground truth labels. This ensures that the model \\(M\\) generates dynamic prompts rather than replicating the exact prompts given in the template pool. The objective is to enable \\(M\\) to mine and discover prompts that are contextually sophisticated and better suited for human mobility forecasting.\n\nThis is a Mobil in WI, Osseo.

This component plays a pivotal role in the prompt generation process, which serves as a critical feedback mechanism to assess the quality and effectiveness of generated prompts. It aids in distinguishing between high-quality and low-quality prompts, thereby guiding the iterative optimization of the model.\n\nBased on the Simple/Complex templates in the template pool, we use a modest portion of (20%) available numerical data to generate prompts. Specifically, we randomly select a template from the pool to make prompts and we make sure the total number of generated Complex prompts is the same as Simple prompts. The central role of this classifier is to perform a binary classification, determining whether a given prompt aligns with a high-quality or a low-quality from the heuristic perspective. Given the heuristics used to generate templates pool lack a concrete quantitative measure to gauge quality performance, a supplementary criterion is essential to fully discern the quality of generated prompts.\n\nEssentially, the prompt generating is a process of information transmission, a translation from the domain of raw data into a descriptive language space."

The choice was driven by accessibility and computational feasibility considerations, as the latter models pose challenges in terms of availability and resource requirements. The maximum length of the prompt generated by the GPT-2 model is limited to 512 tokens. 20% of the data was allocated and passed to the templates given in the heuristic pool for the training of models. The batch size and dropout rate are set as 5 and 0.1, respectively. A learning rate initially is set, and early-stopping is adopted with a patience of 3 epochs to avoid overfitting. \n\nAs for the classifier in the evaluator, given that the task is binary classification, a simple yet effective logistic regression classifier is selected. It uses L2 regularization and sets the reciprocal of the regularization strength as 1, which means that the strength is inversely proportional to the regularization. The model is fitted with the quasi-Newton as the optimization solver and a maximum iteration limit of 100. In the forecasting phase, the total data is split into a training set (70%, for training numerical forecasting methods and fine-tuning language models), a validation set (10%), and a testing set (20%). The raw data is transformed into sentences by the different variants of developed prompts to fine-tune language models for forecasting purposes. The fine-tuning process of the language forecasting models utilizes the standard Trainer provided by HuggingFace. No changes are made to the loss function or other aspects during the fine-tuning of language models in this phase. For the forecasting setting, we observe the mobility data of the last 3 days and predict the mobility of the next day. From the hourly data perspective, the input length is 72 hours and the forecasting horizon is 24 hours. All of the experiments are performed with PyTorch on a Linux server equipped with Nvidia V100 GPUs and only one GPU was utilized."

For language-based forecasting, following previous work (Xue et al., 2022a, b), we first need to extract the predicted numerical values from generated output sentences through string parsing. After extracting the predicted numerical values from the generated sentences, the evaluation of the proposed method can be carried out similarly to how traditional numerical-based forecasting methods are evaluated. We consider two error measures: the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)."

We categorize the baselines into two categories: numerical forecasting methods and language models.\n\nThe numerical baselines include the classic ARIMA, deep learning-based (Prophet (Taylor and Letham, 2018), TimesNet (Wu et al., 2022), LightTS (Zhang et al., 2022), DLinear (Zeng et al., 2023)), and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)-based models (Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2019), Informer (Zhou et al., 2021), Autoformer (Xu et al., 2021), Pyraformer (Liu et al., 2021), Crossformer (Zhang and Yan, 2022), PatchTST (Nie et al., 2022)). Except for ARIMA and Prophet, all the rest of the numerical methods are based on the implementation provided by the Time Series Library (TSlib).\n\nFor the language models, we select three language models with pre-trained weights from HuggingFace: Bart (Lewis et al., 2020), Bigbird (Zaheer et al., 2020), and Pegasus (Zhang et al., 2020).\n\nFrom a recent benchmark study (Xue and Salim, 2023), these 3 models have shown good performance in forecasting time series compared to other language models."

            "text": "In this part of the experiment, we focus on investigating the performance of our mined V1 prompts alongside various baselines. The results of these evaluations are presented in Table 3. For the numerical forecasting baselines, the inputs are the raw hourly visiting data in numbers. For the language models, we also compare V1 against a basic prompt template (e.g., This POI is [STORE TYPE]. There were [HOURLY VISITING DATA] people came here to visit.) drawn from the previous language-based forecasting study (Xue and Salim, 2023). All methods reported in Table 3 predict hourly forecasting during the entire working day.\n\nIn addition to the daily forecasting (the sum of hourly predictions) performance, to make a more accurate comparison with subsequent generated prompts, we also report RMSE and MAE within the first and second half of the working time. It allows better measurement of their predictive performance over different time periods. The best and the second-best performers under each column are shown in red and blue. In general, our V1 outperforms both numerical forecasting methods and the basic prompt without the prompt mining process. While numerical models show competitive results in the second half, the Pegasus model with our V1 prompts consistently maintains a superior performance across different forecasting scenarios. For the same language model, we can see that using V1 leads to better forecasting performance than using the basic prompt. Moreover, for language models, regardless of the prompt employed, both Pegasus and Bigbird showcase superior forecasting performance compared to Bart. The above comparison results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt mining method that can contribute to more accurate forecasting."

            "text": "To have a deeper understanding of our prompt mining approach and its impact on forecasting accuracy, we conduct a detailed analysis of the performance of different prompt variants. Table 4 presents the forecasting performance of the three language models using Prompt V1-V3. In general, we can observe that V3 outperforms V1 and V2 in terms of the daily forecasting results no matter which model is used. For the Bart model, V2 exhibits substantial improvements in accuracy compared to V1, with significant reductions in both RMSE and MAE. V3 also has a large reduction in daily forecast RMSE. In the Bigbird case, V2 and V3 display a remarkable improvement against V1 for the first half day. Although V1 has a better performance in the second half day, V3 still remains the top performer under the daily forecast. Similarly, the outcomes observed for the Pegasus language model are almost the same as the trends apparent in the Bigbird analysis. This analysis of different prompt variants shows the efficacy of our mining method in enhancing mobility forecasting accuracy. The prompt refinements introduced in the prompt mining process, particularly for V3, contribute to improvements in the forecasting performance, which justifies the significance of our approach’s prompt refinement phase."

            "text": "In this part of the experiment, we explore the impact of different segmenting mechanisms used in our prompt refinement stage. Specifically, we investigate how different numbers of segments in our V4 prompts influence forecasting performance. The results of this experimentation are summarized in Table 5, where we also provide the forecasting performance of V3 for easy comparison, which employs diurnal partitioning with 2 segments. Different from Table 3 and Table 4, we calculate the average RMSE/MAE of each segment instead of the first/second half RMSE/MAE since we have settings with more than 2 segments for V4. We also highlight the best and second-best results for each language model separately. Upon analyzing the results, it is evident that the performance of our V4 prompts is influenced by the number of segments. For example, in the case of segment average performance, increasing the number of segments from 2 to 5 (V4) leads to a decreased error for both Bigbird and Pegasus. For the daily forecasting performance, a similar trend can also be noticed for the Bart and Pegasus models. Moreover, the comparison with V3 prompts highlights that our refined V4 prompts generally perform favorably. In conclusion, the results indicate that with a dynamic segmentation strategy offered in our V4 prompts, the language-based forecasting methods can be further improved. Additionally, we observe similar performance on different language models, which demonstrates the adaptability of our prompt mining approach."

We introduce a multi-stage process with a core prompt generation stage and a refinement stage with the consideration of a chain of thought. Our mining pipeline generates and refines prompts for transforming human mobility data into sentences in order to leverage language models for mobility forecasting. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our refined prompts over traditional numerical forecasting methods and basic prompt structures. Our results also highlight the consistent performance improvement across different language models used for the forecasting phase. The future directions of mobility prompt mining can include the integration of external data sources, such as weather and events, which could further provide more context and enhance forecasting capabilities. How to involve human feedback from domain experts in the prompt mining process would be another interesting future research topic."
