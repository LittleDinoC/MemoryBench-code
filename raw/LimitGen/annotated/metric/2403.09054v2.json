    "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as the underpinning architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs). In generative language models, the inference process involves two primary phases: prompt processing and token generation. Token generation, which constitutes the majority of the computational workload, primarily entails vector-matrix multiplications and interactions with the Key-Value (KV) Cache. This phase is constrained by memory bandwidth due to the overhead of transferring weights and KV values from the memory system to the computing units. This memory bottleneck becomes particularly pronounced in applications that require long-context and extensive text generation, both of which are increasingly crucial for LLMs.",

            "text": "Transformers have proven to be particularly successful in tasks such as language modeling Lewis et al. (2019); Brown et al. (2020); Raffel et al. (2020), image recognition Dosovitskiy et al. (2020), recommendations Sun et al. (2019); de Souza Pereira Moreira et al. (2021); Adnan et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2023), and text generation with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, LLM deployment presents critical inference latency and throughput concerns. This is primarily attributed to the sequential autoregressive nature of generative inference, particularly when handling inputs with larger contexts. Despite advancements, modern LLMs face challenges in efficiently processing longer input sequences, as evidenced by recent studies Bai et al. (2023); Li et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023); Huang et al. (2021a). Unfortunately, the increased memory and compute requirements associated with longer sequences exacerbate LLM inference latency and reduce throughput. This paper proposes inference-time strategies for accuracy-preserving, low-latency, high-throughput LLM systems.\n\nLLMs employ Transformers and rely on the ‘attention mechanism’ to understand the relationships between words within a given input sequence Vaswani et al. (2017). As the attention mechanism scales quadratically with the size of the input sequence, it tends to present the largest latency overhead during inference Sukhbaatar et al. (2019); Dao et al. (2022); Choromanski et al. (2020). Additionally, due to the autoregressive nature of token generation in LLMs, there is a need to recompute key and value vectors for all previous tokens. To mitigate this, LLMs utilize a storage structure known as a Key-Value Cache (KVC) Ott et al. (2019). KVC retains previously computed key-value pairs, eliminating the need for costly re-computation of these vectors.\n\nHowever, KVC presents scalability challenges. Accessing the KVC from off-chip memory during token generation introduces additional memory latencies and is constrained by memory bandwidth limitations. For instance, in the MPT-7B model illustrated in Figure 1, increasing the sequence length by 16 (from 512 to 8K) results in a more than 50% increase in inference latency. Moreover, approximately 40% of the total inference time (highlighted in green) is consumed by KVC data movement. Importantly, a larger context not only increases the size of the KVC but also prolongs the time required for other operations (depicted in blue). Similarly, as shown in Figure 1 for the MPT-7B model, the KVC size surpasses the model size when the sequence length exceeds 8K. Thus, KVC sizes present a roadblock to enabling low-latency, high-throughput inference for large sequences.\n\nPrevious studies have explored mitigating attention mechanisms’ memory and computation requirements when dealing with longer sequences Zaheer et al. (2020); Kitaev (2020); Wang et al. (2020); Beltagy et al. (2020). While system-level optimizations like FlexGen Sheng et al. (2023), Flash Attention Dao et al. (2022), Paged Attention Kwon et al. (2023), and multi-dimensional partitioning Pope et al. (2023) aim to improve the scalability of generative AI, they often overlook the fundamental challenge of expanding KVC size. Techniques like multi-query Shazeer (2019) and group-query attention Ainslie et al. (2023) propose reducing KVC size by eliminating specific attention heads from writing to the KVC, but these methods typically require resource-intensive model retraining or fine-tuning. This becomes complex as various accelerators are already deployed in the field. Thus, there is a pressing need for inference-time techniques for KVC reduction. This is even more challenging as any proposed technique must conform to the strict constraints for model accuracy. For instance, MLPerf Reddi et al. (2020) mandates that any optimization applied to LLMs maintain a model accuracy between 99% to 99.9% of the baseline.\n\nTo address these concerns, we introduce a novel method for dynamically reducing the KVC size during inference. It does this by intelligently discarding unnecessary tokens without losing accuracy. The critical insights of the method are demonstrated in Figure 2, where we also compare with existing state-of-the-art inference optimizations. Figure 2(a) illustrates the traditional ‘Full Attention’ Brown et al. (2020) mechanism, where each newly generated token attends to all preceding tokens in the sequence. Figure 2(b) depicts ‘Window Attention,’ Child et al. (2019) which maintains a fixed-size sliding window of recent tokens, thereby reducing the"

When the score distribution is uneven, the model may not attend to the most relevant tokens in the sequence.

Across various reduction budgets, the model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art HO. It shows that the reductions it identifies are more important than the heavy hitters identified by HO. For instance, the model attains the target performance with just 70% of the context, whereas HO fails to reach this goal even with a larger budget. Furthermore, the model surpasses the baseline accuracy by up to 1.73% (0.9% for GPT-J-6B and 1.73% for Cerebras-GPT-6.7B for summarization tasks) achieved with full attention. This demonstrates the regularization effect of the introduced Gumbel noise in the score function and its positive impact on key aspect identification.\n\nWe assessed the effectiveness of the reduction in the model while maintaining accuracy for handling long contexts. This evaluation was conducted on the MPT-7B-story writer model, pre-trained with a context length of 65k. We utilized the Government report dataset, which contains reports authored by government research agencies and features longer summaries and documents. This dataset requires a deep understanding of context to extract crucial information for summarization. The results show the accuracy comparison among the model, HO, and Full Attention. Notably, even with a 50% reduction size, the model maintains the desired 99% accuracy threshold, while HO shows significantly lower accuracy at the same reduction size."

            "text": "To assess the performance advantages of reduced data movement and optimized computation, we considered two critical inference metrics: inference latency and generation throughput for the target models. Our implementation is seamlessly integrated with Huggingface model cards, ensuring ease of adoption. We disabled CPU offloading in cases where the model and data exceeded GPU HBM memory capacity, ensuring consistent evaluation. We generated a synthetic dataset to maintain evaluation consistency, where all prompts were padded with synthetic text. We employed the MPT-7B-storywriter model to generate an equal number of tokens for each prompt. We tested various combinations of prompt and generation lengths.\n\nFigure 9 presents inference latency speedup while Table 1 shows improvement in generation throughput in comparison to a Full Attention-based method. With a 50% reduction, performance significantly reduces inference latency, achieving 2.1x speedup with the same batch size. Moreover, the reduced data size allows the method to handle twice the batch size compared to full attention, increasing token generation throughput by 2x with the same batch size and 2.4x with a bigger batch size.\n\nTo understand the sources of performance benefits with reduced data movement, we primarily consider two factors:\n1. Reduced KV cache: A smaller data size significantly reduces the data movement from off-chip GPU HBM.\n2. Scaled Dot Product Optimization: The number of tokens in the data is reduced.\n\nThese factors contribute to the overall reduction in the size of matrices, enabling an optimized scaled dot product within the multi-head attention block.\n\nIt is worth noting that in memory-bound Large Language Models (LLMs), the main performance boost comes from reducing data movement rather than matrix multiplication. However, the identification process introduces some overhead due to Gumbel softmax. Figure 10 illustrates the normalized performance improvement, considering both reduced data movement and optimized scaled dot product. These enhancements are demonstrated for the MPT-7B-storywriter model with a 50% data reduction, including the additional overhead from Gumbel softmax. The results indicate that data reduction decreases data movement by 2.9x and improves computational efficiency in the attention module’s scaled dot product by 1.3x, particularly for sequences of length 4k."

            "text": "The score function defines what constitutes a target in the context. In generative LLMs with stacked decoder layers, the score function can either be shared across all layers (Shared) or dedicated to each layer (Per-Layer). In the Per-Layer approach, a dedicated score function is assigned to each decoder layer, with accumulation occurring at each decoding stage. Conversely, the Shared approach uses a single global score function for all decoder layers, with accumulation across decoder layers and decoding stages.\n\nTable 3 illustrates the accuracy comparison between Per-Layer and Shared score functions, maintaining the original positional information and target size constant. Notably, using the Per-Layer score function yields better accuracy than the shared score function. This aligns with the intuition that transformers learn hierarchical text representations across layers, with lower layers capturing local syntactic and semantic features and higher layers capturing more abstract and complex patterns Geng et al. (2023). Therefore, having a Per-Layer score function for each layer aids in target identification specific to that layer."

Nevertheless, even with new positional information, it outperforms the state-of-the-art HO."

However, this trend strains system memory bandwidth, leading to execution costs. In longer contexts, the memory consumption, primarily responsible for memory bandwidth consumption and inference latency, exceeds the model parameters’ size. To address this, we proposed a method that effectively reduces memory consumption up to 50% without sacrificing accuracy by discarding tokens across heads, layers, and beams, identifying essential tokens based on a novel score function. This method can be applied to LLMs at inference time, without requiring fine-tuning, while also improving latency and token generation throughput."
