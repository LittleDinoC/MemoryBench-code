    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In this paper, we study leveraging knowledge graph embeddings to improve the effectiveness of PEFT. We propose a knowledgeable adaptation method called KnowLA. It inserts an adaptation layer into an LLM to integrate the embeddings of entities appearing in the input text. The adaptation layer is trained in combination with LoRA on instruction data. Experiments on six benchmarks with two popular LLMs and three knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of KnowLA. We show that KnowLA can help activate the relevant parameterized knowledge in an LLM to answer a question without changing its parameters or input prompts.",

            "text": "In the era of large language models (LLMs) with billions and possibly trillions of parameters, parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) stands out as a crucial technique enabling the necessary adaptation of LLMs to downstream tasks. It freezes most or even all parameters of LLMs and only finetunes a small number of parameters using limited instruction data. LoRA is a widely-used PEFT method that trains small low-rank adapters to approximate the large layers in LLMs. Follow-up work improves the efficiency of LoRA by using quantized weights. In this work, we seek to improve the effectiveness of LoRA while preserving comparable efficiency.\n\nInspired by knowledge-injected pre-trained language models (PLMs), we explore knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the PEFT of LLMs with LoRA. A KG is a large-scale structured knowledge base containing a massive amount of trustworthy knowledge. The typical way of injecting KGs into PLMs in the past few years is incorporating pre-trained entity embeddings at the input layer of a PLM and finetuning the full model on NLP tasks. Knowledge injection has improved many PLMs.\n\nHowever, previous knowledge injection methods require fully tuning PLMs, which is inapplicable to LLMs. Furthermore, these methods are founded on the encoder-based architecture of PLMs, and their effectiveness for recent decoder-based LLMs remains unknown. The following questions thereby arise: Can knowledge injection still enhance the PEFT of LLMs? Also, how can knowledge injection be used to enhance PEFT?\n\nTo answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a knowledgeable adaptation method for PEFT, particularly for LoRA, called KnowLA. It inserts an adaptation layer into a pre-trained LLM. The layer integrates external KG embeddings of entities appearing in the input text of the LLM. Entity embeddings and parameters of the LLM are frozen in PEFT. The proposed adaptation layer is trained combined with LoRA on instruction data. The parameters in our adaptation layer are significantly fewer than those in the LLM and even fewer than those in LoRA. Thus, our KnowLA is also a parameter-efficient method without changing the original parameters of the LLM.\n\nWe evaluate KnowLA on six datasets, including commonsense reasoning on CommonsenseQA, social interaction reasoning on SIQA and BIG-Bench Hard, single-hop reasoning of KBQA on WebQuestionSP, and close-book QA on TriviaQA and TruthfulQA. KnowLA enhances the effectiveness of LoRA at the expense of a limited number of additional parameters. We assess the robustness of KnowLA with two popular foundation models, different instruction data, various KGs, and typical embedding learning models, combined with two PEFT methods.\n\nTo understand how KnowLA changes the output of an LLM, we analyze the results from two perspectives, which show several interesting findings: (i) KnowLA with LoRA can align the space of the LLM with the space of KG embeddings, and (ii) KnowLA can activate the parameterized potential knowledge that originally exists in the LLM, even though the used KG does not contain such knowledge. According to our findings, in some cases, the LLM outputs incorrect answers not because it does not know the answers, but because its relevant knowledge is not activated by the input prompts. KnowLA can help activate its relevant knowledge without changing its parameters or input prompts."

Then, we retrieve the top five similar entity embeddings in the KG for each token. Next, to establish the relevance of each token and its corresponding entities, we calculate the attention weights between them. A larger weight suggests a stronger semantic correlation between the token and the mapped entity. In the case of Llama 2 (depicted in the left part of Figure 3  ###reference_###), the similarities between entity embeddings and token representations appear to be random, lacking any discernible patterns. However, after applying KnowLA, the results show that the KnowLA can effectively align the KG and the LLM through instruction tuning with LoRA. For token “underrated”, the relevant entities in ConceptNet are “underrated”, “underrate”, etc. After finetuning, the token “underrated” exhibits the highest correlation with the entity “underrated”. This observation indicates that KnowLA can effectively align the KG and the LLM through instruction tuning with LoRA. ###figure_2### We study the role of KnowLA in activating an LLM’s knowledge. According to Li et al. (2023  ###reference_b18###); Geva et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###); Meng et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###), the feed-forward network (FFN) layers, which constitute two-thirds of an LLM’s parameters, primarily capture its own knowledge. So, we explore the impact of KnowLA on the FFN layers to see how KnowLA affects these layers in activating knowledge stored in the LLM. ###figure_3### We compute the differences between the hidden state representations of the last token before and after each FFN layer in the LLM. \n\nWe analyze the trends in differences of all 32 layers after inserting KnowLA. We use the 100 questions from TriviaQA as queries to explore the knowledge stored in the FFN layers of Llama 2 (7B). The last token representation in each input aggregates information from all tokens. According to Li et al. (2023  ###reference_b18###), there is a positive correlation between the similarity of hidden states and the consistency of knowledge. Intuitively, we believe that higher differences in representations indicate the model’s ability to capture more information from the FFN layers. Therefore, we extract the representations of the last token before and after each FFN layer and compute the cosine similarities for Llama 2, KnowLA, and Alpaca2, which are denoted by each model.\n\nGiven the token similarities, we further evaluate the capacities of KnowLA and Llama 2 in capturing hidden knowledge. The capacities are measured by the computed similarities. The results are shown in Figure 4  ###reference_###. The red color indicates that the representation of the last token, after introducing KnowLA and undergoing the FFN layers, exhibits a greater change compared to that of Alpaca2. The blue color shows the opposite. We think the representations with greater changes capture more internal knowledge. After introducing entity embeddings, KnowLA enables the LLM to activate richer knowledge at the FFN layers. In contrast, Llama 2 captures less knowledge than Alpaca2.\n\nAccording to the work Geva et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###), lower FFN layers tend to capture shallow knowledge patterns, while higher FFN layers learn more semantic patterns. Our KnowLA demonstrates enhanced knowledge activation capabilities at the higher layers. By examining the differences in similarity across the last 16 layers, we find that KnowLA (ConceptNet) shows the greatest similarity difference in the three KGs and performs best on TriviaQA. This further emphasizes that the introduction of ConceptNet substantially activates more knowledge stored internally in Llama 2."

We also consider randomly initialized vectors as a baseline of KG embeddings. Our KnowLA variants show the best performance across the three datasets. Furthermore, Alpaca2 () outperforms Alpaca2 (), because more trainable parameters usually lead to better performance. KAPING generally performs better than Contriever on CommonsenseQA. This indicates that the RAG methods rely on the quality of prompts retrieved from the knowledge sources. Both KAPING and Contriever are inferior to Alpaca2 () on CommonsenseQA and SIQA, as invalid prompts may cause damage to the performance. KnowLA is different from RAG methods. RAG methods retrieve text information to augment the input of LLMs, while KnowLA uses KG embeddings to improve the effectiveness of PEFT. KnowLA works in the finetuning phase of LLMs and does not change the input of LLMs. Our method with LoRA () achieves better performance than all baselines, indicating that it can effectively work with PEFT to inject knowledge. Specifically, when combined with ConceptNet, it achieves an increase from to on CommonsenseQA, from to on SIQA, and from to on BBH. Since ConceptNet stores rich conceptual knowledge and more relation types compared to WordNet, its entity embeddings can better enhance Llama 2’s reasoning ability. Furthermore, ConceptNet recognizes more relevant entities in the question than Wikidata. This suggests that extensive entity coverage in KnowLA brings a significant performance increase. Additionally, the performance of KnowLA (random) is inferior to that of KnowLA with KGs, highlighting the greater utility of entity knowledge for LLMs. Therefore, KnowLA can offer a certain degree of improvement for LLMs in commonsense reasoning."

According to the results, KnowLA combined with WordNet improves the results on TriviaQA, while combined with ConceptNet, the performance is further enhanced. This indicates that the parameterized entity embeddings can enrich the textual representations. The experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-enhanced textual representations after finetuning with LoRA can help mitigate the hallucination problem of Llama 2 to some extent. On WebQuestionSP, KnowLA (WordNet) and KnowLA (Wikidata) produce similar results. Also, the two Alpaca2 models with different ranks perform similarly.

Therefore, we extract the representations of the last token before and after each FFN layer and compute the cosine similarities for Llama 2, KnowLA, and Alpaca2.\n\nAfter introducing entity embeddings, KnowLA enables the LLM to activate richer knowledge at the FFN layers. In contrast, Llama 2 captures less knowledge than Alpaca2. According to the work Geva et al. (2021), lower FFN layers tend to capture shallow knowledge patterns, while higher FFN layers learn more semantic patterns. Our KnowLA demonstrates enhanced knowledge activation capabilities at the higher layers.\n\nBy examining the differences in similarity across the last 16 layers, we find that KnowLA (ConceptNet) shows the greatest similarity difference in the three KGs. This further emphasizes that the introduction of ConceptNet substantially activates more knowledge stored internally in Llama 2."

We obtain entity embeddings of ConceptNet by three representative KG embedding models: RESCAL Nickel et al. (2011  ###reference_b26###), TransE Bordes et al. (2013  ###reference_b2###), and RotatE Sun et al. (2019  ###reference_b38###). RotatE employs complex vector representations for entities. This suggests that aligning the complex space of entities with the semantic space of Llama 2 during finetuning is challenging, leading to a loss of original entity knowledge."

KnowLA with Llama 2 shows better performance on six benchmark datasets. We show that pre-trained KG embeddings are compatible with Llama 2. Moreover, we find that KnowLA can align the KG space and the LLM space, and activate the hidden knowledge related to input in LLMs, thereby achieving improved performance."
