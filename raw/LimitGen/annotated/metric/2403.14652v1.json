    "title": "MemeCraft: Contextual and Stance-Driven Multimodal Meme Generation",
    "abstract": "Online memes have emerged as powerful digital cultural artifacts in the age of social media, offering not only humor but also platforms for political discourse, social critique, and information dissemination. Their extensive reach and influence in shaping online communities’ sentiments make them invaluable tools for campaigning and promoting ideologies.\n\nDespite the development of several meme-generation tools, there remains a gap in their systematic evaluation and their ability to effectively communicate ideologies. Addressing this, we introduce MemeCraft, an innovative meme generator that leverages large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) to produce memes advocating specific social movements. MemeCraft presents an end-to-end pipeline, transforming user prompts into compelling multimodal memes without manual intervention. Conscious of the misuse potential in creating divisive content, an intrinsic safety mechanism is embedded to curb hateful meme production.\n\nOur assessment, focusing on two UN Sustainable Development Goals—Climate Action and Gender Equality—shows MemeCraft’s prowess in creating memes that are both funny and supportive of advocacy goals. This paper highlights how generative AI can promote social good and pioneers the use of LLMs and VLMs in meme generation.",

            "text": "Online memes represent digital cultural artifacts that have become pervasive in the era of social media. Typically comprised of images, videos, or text, memes frequently convey humor, irony, or satire, rendering them highly shareable and relatable to a broad audience. These memes can disseminate rapidly, at times achieving viral status, and wield substantial influence in shaping the collective sentiments and trends of the online community. Beyond their comedic aspect, memes can also serve as conduits for political discourse, social critique, and the dissemination of information. Multiple research endeavors have explored the communicative prowess of memes, suggesting their efficacy as both a communication and campaigning instrument (Msugheter, 2020; Moody-Ramirez and Church, 2019; Kulkarni, 2017). Such studies affirm memes’ unparalleled reach and persuasiveness, often harnessed by individuals and groups to campaign for social movements or advancing ideologies. For instance, Zhang and Pinto (2021) found that exposure to climate change-themed memes increases individuals’ intentions to engage in online civic discourse concerning climate change.\n\nIn response to the soaring popularity and applicability of memes, both academic researchers and the tech industry have presented an array of tools to aid in meme generation (Peirson and Tolunay, 2018; Sadasivam et al., 2020; Vyalla and Udandarao, 2020). Semi-automated tools such as Imgflip offer users the capacity to overlay text on pre-existing meme templates. While these tools enhance meme creation efficiency through deep learning, they typically require extensive training with large datasets. For example, Dank Learning (Peirson and Tolunay, 2018) used a dataset of 400,000 memes from Memegenerator.net, and Memeify (Vyalla and Udandarao, 2020) collected 1.1 million memes from QuickMeme for training. In contrast, our approach leverages large models effectively with only a few demonstration memes, achieving similar performance while drastically reducing training costs.\n\nMoreover, current evaluations of meme-generation tools are not systematic. Existing studies primarily assess the resemblance of automatically generated memes to their manually crafted counterparts (Peirson and Tolunay, 2018; Sadasivam et al., 2020). They often overlook evaluating the ability of these generated memes to effectively and persuasively communicate specific ideologies. To address these gaps, we introduce MemeCraft, a state-of-the-art, multimodal meme generator that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) to generate humorous memes that convey specific contexts and stances as directed by users. Specifically, MemeCraft is an end-to-end pipeline that generates multimodal memes from specially designed prompts that aim to advocate specific social movements. Our proposed meme generator automatically takes an image and generates a text overlay to convert the image into a humorous meme that advocates the specified social causes. With MemeCraft, users can effortlessly craft natural, compelling memes, aligning with extensive social and communication campaigns.\n\nRecent studies have also indicated that malicious users have created and circulated hateful memes, exacerbating societal discord, perpetuating stereotypes, and disseminating false information (Hermida and Santos, 2023; Sharma et al., 2022). To counteract potential misuse of MemeCraft, we have implemented a self-regulating safety mechanism. This feature ensures MemeCraft does not produce hateful memes, maintaining a platform free from abusive or offensive content.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of MemeCraft as a social campaigning tool, we first generate a large dataset of memes concentrated around two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) (Hák et al., 2016): “Climate Action” and “Gender Equality”. The dataset encompasses memes both in favor of and against these pivotal goals. Subsequently, we conduct a comprehensive human evaluation to assess the quality of these generated memes on hilarity, message conveyance, and persuasiveness. Additionally, we also evaluate the robustness of MemeCraft’s safety mechanism against the creation of hateful content.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) We introduced MemeCraft which is an innovative meme generator utilizing LLMs or VLMs to produce large-scale advocacy memes. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering exploration of adapting LLMs or VLMs for meme generation. (ii) We conducted an extensive human evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our proposed meme generator in promoting SDGs (i.e., climate action and gender equality). Our experiment results show that MemeCraft outperformed the state-of-the-art meme generators in generating humorous and persuasive memes that advocate these social movements. At a higher level, our study explores and demonstrates the potential of leveraging generative AI to promote social good."

            "text": "Internet memes are a significant cultural phenomenon in online communication. Extensive research has focused on analyzing topics (Du et al., 2020  ###reference_b7###), semantics (Xu et al., 2022  ###reference_b45###), and emotions (Sharma et al., 2020  ###reference_b37###) conveyed in memes. An important application of meme analysis is the detection of hateful memes. Detection of hateful memes is crucial due to their potential misuse for spreading harmful messages (Kiela et al., 2020  ###reference_b13###; Mathias et al., 2021  ###reference_b21###), misinformation (Pramanick et al., 2021a  ###reference_b30###; Naseem et al., 2023  ###reference_b25###), and propaganda (Dimitrov et al., 2021  ###reference_b6###). Efforts to develop models for detecting harmful memes have intensified in academia and industry (Pramanick et al., 2021b  ###reference_b31###; Thakur et al., 2022  ###reference_b39###; Kirk et al., 2021  ###reference_b14###; Lee et al., 2021  ###reference_b17###; Hee et al., 2022  ###reference_b10###; Cao et al., 2023  ###reference_b2###; Hee et al., 2023  ###reference_b9###; Zhu et al., 2022  ###reference_b53###; Cao et al., 2022  ###reference_b3###).\nThe generation of memes has evolved significantly over time. Initial models primarily relied on rule-based methods for meme creation  (Wang and Wen, 2015  ###reference_b43###; Oliveira et al., 2016  ###reference_b26###). With the emergence of deep learning techniques, novel methodologies have been proposed. Peirson and Tolunay (Peirson and Tolunay, 2018  ###reference_b29###) presented the Dank Learning approach, which employs the Inception V3 architecture for image encoding and an attention-driven, deeper-layer LSTM for decoding, facilitating the generation of meme captions for images. Subsequent models, including MemeBot (Sadasivam et al., 2020  ###reference_b34###) and Memeify (Vyalla and Udandarao, 2020  ###reference_b42###), incorporate text input and harness transformer-based architectures. Evaluation metrics for these models commonly include differentiability between generated memes and human-craft memes, user satisfaction, and the humor quotient.\nCollectively, prior research has provided valuable insights into the methodologies of meme generation. Building on these foundational works, our research introduces a novel meme generator designed to bolster social movements. Differing from existing tools, our proposed model employs LLMs and VLMs to craft humorous memes at scale to communicate specific social causes and stances as determined by the users. Additionally, we enhance the existing studies by conducting a thorough human-centric evaluation, assessing the efficacy of our model in advocating social campaigns."

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs), characterized by vast parameter sizes often in the range of billions, are pre-trained on expansive natural language datasets. Notable examples include GPT-3 (Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b4###), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020  ###reference_b33###), and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022  ###reference_b36###). A defining feature of these LLMs is their ability to perform exceptionally well on novel tasks with only task instructions provided, a capability termed as zero-shot in-context learning. To enhance this performance, certain models undergo post-pre-training refinements. Specifically, T0 (Sanh et al., 2022  ###reference_b35###) and FLAN (Wei et al., 2021  ###reference_b44###) are fine-tuned across various tasks, outperforming GPT-3 in zero-shot scenarios. InstructGPT(Ouyang et al., 2022  ###reference_b28###) undergoes refinement from GPT-3 via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), thereby improving its adherence to instructions. Additionally, ChatGPT333https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt  ###reference_openai.com/blog/chatgpt###, which originates from InstructGPT, is fine-tuned with conversational datasets using RLHF, enabling it to engage in dialogues and provide detailed responses to user queries. Touvron et al. (Touvron et al., 2023  ###reference_b40###) introduced LLaMA, a suite of efficient Large Language Models with parameter sizes ranging from 7B to 65B. Despite their reduced scale, these LLMs have proven to be highly competitive when compared to their larger counterparts. In this study, we investigated the use of online LLM APIs, such as ChatGPT, as well as offline models like LLaMA for meme generation. To our knowledge, this is the inaugural study that harnesses LLMs for meme creation and thoroughly assesses their capability to produce humorous memes.\n###figure_2### Recent advancements in the vision-language domain have led to the emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) known for their robust generative abilities (Ye et al., 2023  ###reference_b46###; Dai et al., 2023  ###reference_b5###; Liu et al., 2023  ###reference_b20###; Zhu et al., 2023b  ###reference_b52###; Li et al., 2023a  ###reference_b19###; OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b27###). These nascent VLMs set themselves apart from the prevailing smaller versions by virtue of their extensive model size and superior performance in multimodal understanding tasks. Recent research indicates that VLMs demonstrate noteworthy zero-shot capabilities across various multimodal tasks (Zheng et al., 2023  ###reference_b50###), highlighting their potential applicability in diverse downstream applications such as image captioning. Examples of these advancements include ChatCaptioner (Zhu et al., 2023a  ###reference_b51###), which integrates ChatGPT with BLIP-2 for image captioning, and LLaVA-Med (Li et al., 2023b  ###reference_b18###), which utilizes GPT-4 for queries related to biomedical images. Drawing inspiration from these existing studies, we leverage LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023  ###reference_b20###) visual comprehension and text generation prowess for meme creation."

As most viral memes are generated based on popular meme template images, we first sample meme template images from online repositories like Imgflip. The sampled images are then processed using a VLM to derive their textual descriptions (i.e., captions). Following this, we input the name of the meme template and generated descriptions into either an LLM or VLM to produce humorous meme texts that align with specific social causes, such as ”climate action” and ”gender equality. To create the final memes, the generated meme texts are superimposed on the sampled meme template images using a text overlay API. Finally, to ensure that our proposed framework does not generate hateful memes, we use a pre-trained model dedicated to detecting hateful memes to filter the generated memes. Only memes deemed non-hateful are kept in our generated dataset. The details of each\nMemeCraft component are discussed in the subsequent subsections."

            "text": "The goal of this task is to produce meme text that, when combined with a meme template image, results in a multimodal meme that communicates a campaign message. This message is guided by three user-defined parameters:\nSocial Cause: This denotes the social issue or movement the meme addresses. While our experiments focused on two causes, namely “climate action” and “gender equality”, it is noteworthy that MemeCraft can generate memes for a broader range of social topics.\nStance: This determines whether the meme will support or deny the chosen social cause.\nPersuasion Technique: This specifies the method employed to sway the audience towards supporting or opposing the social cause. As an example, a strategy for championing climate action might highlight the consequences of climate change. Although several persuasion methods are versatile and fit various causes, some causes might necessitate specialized techniques. The specific techniques used for “climate action” and “gender equality” are elaborated in the next section.\nTo generate meme text that conveys the intended social campaign message, we employ prompts based on the three user-defined parameters and pair them with randomly selected meme template images. An exemplary prompt supporting “climate action” using the causes of climate change as a persuasion technique is demonstrated in Table 1  ###reference_###. We enhance this prompt with the prefix “Let’s think step by step.” (Zhang et al., 2022  ###reference_b49###). This prefix encourages LLMs to establish a stronger connection between the image and meme text, ensuring the generated text closely aligns with the visual content.\n###table_1### # Demonstration samples\nInstruction: Generate a caption to turn the image into a humorous meme that highlights the Causes of Climate Change to Support it.\nInput: Image ”willywonka” describing ”A man wearing a purple and gold suit, a top hat, and…”\nOutput: [Let’s think step-by-step.] The ”willywonka” image is frequently employed sarcastically, often with rhetorical questions. Let’s use it for… Caption at top: ”You think global warming is fake?” and Caption at bottom: ”Please tell me how you get the ”FACTS” from politicians and oil companies”\n###\n# Actual image in prompt\nInstruction: Generate a caption to turn the image into a humorous meme that highlights the Causes of Climate Change to Support it.\nInput: Image ”Waiting Skeleton” describing ”The image features an old skeleton bone sitting on a park bench…”\nOutput: [Let’s think step-by-step.]\nThe ”Waiting Skeleton” image is often used to depict patience or waiting with a touch of irony. Let’s use this image for… Caption at top: ”Waiting for the forests to magically grow back”\nIn our study, we utilize three models as variations of MemeCraft to generate humorous meme text based on our specifically designed prompts: ChatGPT-3.5555https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions  ###reference_###, LLaMA-2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023  ###reference_b40###), and LLaVA-7B (Liu et al., 2023  ###reference_b20###).\nFor the LLMs, namely ChatGPT and LLaMA, we adopt a few-shots prompting technique, illustrated in Table 1  ###reference_###. Through various tests, we evaluated the effectiveness of providing different numbers of demonstration examples, denoted as , varying from 2 to 8. Our observations revealed that when  is minimal, such as 2, LLaMA faces challenges in comprehending the task. On the other hand, when  is increased to values like 6 or 8, LLaMA tends to mimic the provided examples. As a result, we empirically settled on presenting 4 demonstration examples.\nIn contrast, LLaVA, a VLM, does not support the few-shots prompting technique. Hence, we employed a zero-shot prompting method for this model. While the structure of the prompting format aligns with the template presented in Table 1  ###reference_###—comprising Instruction, Input, and Output segments—it does not incorporate any demonstration samples. Additionally, the prefix “Let’s think step-by-step” is excluded from the output, prompting the VLM to generate the meme text directly."

In light of this, we have enhanced MemeCraft with a safety mechanism to mitigate the risk of generating such content. This mechanism involves the critical evaluation of generated memes for potential hateful content.\nCentral to our approach is the employment of the MultiModal BiTransformers (MMBT-Grid) model, a dedicated hateful memes detection technique introduced in (Kiela et al., 2019  ###reference_b12###). MMBT-Grid adopts a multimodal supervised bitransformer architecture, which utilizes distinct unimodal components. These components have been trained to associate multimodal image embeddings with textual tokens.\nOur choice of MMBT-Grid is supported by its thorough pre-training on the Hateful Meme Challenge (HMC) Dataset, a prominent benchmark for identifying hateful content (Kiela et al., 2020  ###reference_b13###). MMBT-Grid achieves 66.85% accuracy on this dataset (Van and Wu, 2023  ###reference_b41###). To balance the generation of diverse memes while prioritizing safety, we established a high confidence threshold of 0.9 to classify content as hateful. Any content exceeding this threshold is excluded. Memes that are validated through this mechanism are added to our final dataset."

The generated dataset will be used in our large-scale human evaluation in the subsequent section.\nFor each social cause, we first design prompts with persuasion techniques to generate the memes. These memes aim to influence people to support or oppose the given cause. Specifically, we use the following techniques for persuasion:\nCauses: This technique emphasizes factors that can contribute to or intensify the social causes. This approach is used in supporting “climate action” and “gender equality”. An illustrative example involves a meme that accuses individuals of failing to switch off lights every time they exit a room in the context of “climate action”.\nConsequences: This technique emphasizes the potential negative consequences that may arise from underlying social causes. This approach is used in supporting “climate action” and “gender equality”. An illustrative example includes a meme that emphasizes how global warming affects everyone, not just polar bears, within the context of “climate action”.\nSolutions: This technique offers solutions and encourages individuals to take action in addressing the social causes. This approach is used in supporting “climate action” and “gender equality”. An illustrative example involves a meme that highlights the idea that single-use plastic can be environmentally friendly if it’s reused, within the context of “climate action”.\nEvidence of Absence: This technique presents evidence suggesting that the social causes either do not exist or are not significant problems. This approach is used in denying “climate action” and “gender equality”. An illustrative example includes a meme that emphasizes the recent increase in the number of polar bears within the context of “climate action”.\nBenefits: This technique highlights the idea that the social causes could have positive effects for us. This approach is used in denying “climate action”. An illustrative example includes a meme that emphasizes how farmers can now cultivate plants year-round due to global warming.\nRationale: This technique emphasizes that the existence of a social causes is supported by valid reasons. This approach is used in denying “gender equality”. An example includes a meme that underscores the notion that because women and men have distinct physical differences, it is natural to treat them differently.\nAfter establishing the persuasion technique, we generate memes focused on “climate action” and “gender equality” using the three variations of MemeCraft: ChatGPT, LLaMA, and LLaVA. Each MemeCraft variation produces 500 memes for each social cause. The distribution of the generated memes for our human evaluation is displayed in Table 2  ###reference_###. In total, MemeCraft was used to produce 3,000 memes. For comparison, we also created 100 memes with the state-of-the-art Dank Learning meme generator (Peirson and Tolunay, 2018  ###reference_b29###), and randomly sampled 100 online memes from ImgFlip."

To address the research questions outlined in our study, we developed five evaluation metrics to assess the various aspects of the generated memes comprehensively.  \nHilarity: This metric evaluates the humor of the generated meme. Evaluators rate the humor of a meme using a 5-point scale, with 1 indicating “not humorous” and 5 indicating “humorous”.  \nMessage Conveyance: This metric evaluates the capacity of generated memes to adeptly convey the intended message, particularly in terms of supporting or denying specific social causes. Evaluators categorize each meme as either “support”, “deny”, or exhibiting no clear alignment (“NA”) with the specified social cause. The Message Conveyance score is computed by the percentage of memes evaluated to convey the specified social cause and stance.  \nPersuasiveness: This metric measures the persuasive quality of the generated memes. Evaluators rate the persuasiveness of memes on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 signified “not persuasive” and 5 signified “persuasive”.  \nHatefulness: This metric assesses the effectiveness of a safety mechanism in mitigating the generation of hateful memes. The safety mechanism classifies generated memes as either hateful or non-hateful and filters out the hateful ones. Evaluators are tasked to identify the presence of hateful content within the remaining memes.

We also noted that the LLM-based models, MemeCraft-ChatGPT and MemeCraft-LLaMA, perform better than the VLM-base model, MemeCraft-LLaVA. The observed performance disparity can be attributed to the inherent limitations of the LLaVA model, which exclusively relies on zero-shot learning capabilities. Unlike other models that can learn and improve from demonstration examples, LLaVA operates without such examples in its prompts, leading to comparatively suboptimal performance. Comparatively, the baseline model Dank Learning yielded a median hilarity score of only 1, indicating a general lack of humor in its generated memes.

The technique we have termed “Causes” emerged as the most effective, yielding approximately 0.7 supportive memes when utilized by MemeCraft-ChatGPT and MemeCraft-LLaMA, i.e., among the memes generated using the “Causes” technique, about 70% of these memes are evaluated as supporting the social cause. Additionally, other supportive strategies registered efficacy scores exceeding 0.6 with MemeCraft-ChatGPT. In contrast, persuasion strategies specifically designed to deny social causes produced approximately 30% of memes that still advocated for the cause.\n\nIn our analysis of memes evaluated as denying social causes, we discovered that memes utilizing supportive persuasion techniques rarely adopted an opposing viewpoint, with only approximately 10% doing so. Conversely, the efficacy of various denied persuasion techniques generally yielded a low conversion to contrarian memes. A significant outlier was observed with the “Evidence of Absence” technique in the context of the “climate action” social cause when applied in the MemeCraft-LLaMA model. Here, 76% of the generated memes opposed the cause. This anomaly was attributed to the MemeCraft-LLaMA model’s replication of patterns from provided demonstration examples during the meme generation process."

            "text": "Figure 4 and 5 present the persuasiveness score distributions of various models generating “climate action” and “gender equality” memes, respectively. Overall, we observed that MemeCraft-ChatGPT outperformed other MemeCraft models in both social causes, with around 40% of memes receiving a rating of 3 out of 5 persuasiveness score. It is noteworthy that different persuasion techniques could exhibit varying levels of performance. In general, within the social cause of “climate action”, persuasion techniques emphasizing support tended to perform better. In the context of the “Solutions” technique employed within MemeCraft-ChatGPT, it notably attained a persuasive score of 3 for more than 50% of the evaluated memes. Conversely, in the social cause of “gender equality”, the disparity in persuasiveness scores between support and deny persuasion techniques was less pronounced. In summary, the memes we generated demonstrate moderate persuasive, and the persuasiveness scores are notably influenced by the social causes and persuasion techniques used. These findings suggest that tailoring persuasion techniques to specific social causes is crucial for enhancing the persuasive impact of the memes."

            "text": "Table 5 presents two sets of hatefulness scores: (i) hateful memes identified by MemeCraft’s safety mechanism (machine), and (ii) the hateful memes identified by the evaluators in the set post-filtered by the safety mechanism. In contentious social issues like \"gender equality,\" our safety mechanism notably detects a markedly higher proportion of memes as hateful, highlighting the risk for LLMs to propagate hate speech (Kumar et al., 2024). This underscores the need for caution when creating memes in such social causes. Following the removal of memes identified as hateful by our models, we engaged human annotators to assess the remaining memes for hatefulness. After applying our safety mechanism, we found that the percentage of hateful memes in both social causes consistently remained below 0.05, which is lower than that of two baselines. While \"gender equality\" social cause had a slightly higher proportion of hateful memes, the percentages still stayed within acceptable limits. This serves as empirical evidence affirming the efficacy of our framework for filtering out hateful memes."

            "text": "Table 6 presents selected high-quality and low-quality memes across various models. Analysis of these case studies indicates that high-quality memes typically demonstrate a seamless integration of text and imagery, which together produce humor and a coherent message. A prime example is meme 2, where Drake’s popular reaction image aptly satirizes the rejection of outdated gender stereotypes. In contrast, low-quality memes can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there may be a lack of semantic connection between the text and the image, as observed in memes 5 and 6. While the text may possess individual meaning, its relationship with the accompanying visual element is unclear. Secondly, some low-quality memes suffer from nonsensical textual content, as exemplified by meme 7. These memes fail to convey coherent messages, diminishing their overall quality. Finally, certain memes addressing sensitive topics may carry a latent risk of being labeled as hateful, as evidenced in the case of meme 8, which appears to downplay white people’s historical involvement in the enslavement of Black individuals, potentially undermining their overall credibility."

            "text": "In conclusion, our development of the MemeCraft generator constitutes a noteworthy advancement in automated meme creation. The research presented herein illustrates that by utilizing LLMs and VLMs, which have been pre-trained on comprehensive datasets, our system is capable of producing memes that closely mirror those found within online communities and maintain contextual relevance while being devoid of offensive content. The generator has achieved satisfactory metrics in terms of persuasiveness and hilarity, indicating the utility of memes as a medium for supporting distinct societal objectives. While there is still room for improvement in achieving humor scores comparable to real online memes, our framework has significantly narrowed the gap. For future works, we aim to refine the synergy between textual and visual elements to enhance both the comedic and persuasive qualities of the generated memes, thereby contributing to the progressive evolution of meme generation technology."
