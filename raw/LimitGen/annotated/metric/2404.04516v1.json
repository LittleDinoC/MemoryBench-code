    "title": "Language Models as Critical Thinking Tools: A Case Study of Philosophers",
    "abstract": "Current work in language models (LMs) helps us speed up or even skip thinking by accelerating and automating cognitive work. But can LMs help us with critical thinking – thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts? We treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs. Using our findings, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. We hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other ‘critical thinkers’ to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs.",

            "text": "Language Models (LMs) have recently alleviated a whole host of our intellectual inconveniences. They can help us do things we would have begrudgingly done by ourselves otherwise: write code, generate emails, and translate text. In sparking ideas by generating stories and concept designs, LMs offer shortcuts to gaining new thoughts. They also help us put our thinking into words by revising and giving feedback on our writing. In all these cases, LMs help us speed up and circumvent the inconveniences of thinking ourselves.\n\nIn many contexts, however, the “inconvenience” of thinking is not a temporary problem to be alleviated, but a deep puzzle to be reflected upon. Many people are invested in specific areas of intellectual inquiry – e.g., historians, scientists, philosophers – and more generally, in reflection and engagement with the world – e.g., as informed political citizens, critical consumers of media, and moral actors. They are interested in identifying and challenging assumptions, clarifying muddled ideas, and engineering new and useful ways to think. Core to this sort of inquiry is critical thinking – “the propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism.”\n\nCan LMs serve as tools for critical thinking – helping us think more deeply and in more complex ways, rather than faster or not at all?\n\nTo investigate how LMs can serve as critical thinking tools, we use philosophers as a case study – philosophers being people who are in the business of thinking critically about a wide range of concepts and ideas. We interview 21 professional philosophers to understand their thinking processes, collect their experiences with and views on current LMs, and brainstorm the roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools in philosophy.\n\nWe find that current philosophers do not think LMs are good critical thinking tools for two primary reasons: LMs are too neutral, detached, and nonjudgmental; and LMs are too servile, passive, and incurious. We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, which explains why philosophers find conversations with other philosophers and reading philosophical texts to be more helpful for their work than current LMs. Using the model, we describe three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. Finally, we outline how these LMs could inform metaphilosophical questions and shape the discipline of philosophy, and discuss challenges in building LMs and interfaces for critical thinking."

            "text": "A large and growing literature investigates how LMs can serve as thinking tools for humans engaged in intellectual work. This research tends to concern how LMs can serve two intellectual functions: idea stimulation and idea expression. LMs can provide stimulus for ideas – information and formulations which provoke and guide creative processes. In these roles, LMs expand the set of ideas available, which can become inspiration for thinking. These LMs may continue to provide stimulus while engaging in the process. For instance, LMs can produce creative analogies, metaphors, and ‘sparks’ to stimulate serious thinking. Existing pools of ideas might be expanded with LMs. Creative writers may use LMs to propose plots, characters, and entire stories; designers may use LMs to generate concept designs; scientists may use LMs to find literature and (re)formulate problems in novel ways.\n\nOn the other hand, LMs can also aid the expression of ideas (in language). It is assumed that there is an idea in mind and LMs can be used to find the formulation which best represents it. LMs can help ‘translate ideas into words’ by making suggested revisions and helping clarify writing goals. Writing feedback given by LMs may be more useful, more motivating, and more engaging than feedback given by other humans."

            "text": "One part of the thinking process is clearly missing. One does not simply go from the stimulus for an idea to figuring out how to express the idea: critical thinking involves reflection upon ideas, judgment, and conceptual engineering. Language Models (LMs) can help provide the seeds for our ideas when we don’t have any (i.e., stimulus) and help us formulate them once we’ve got them (i.e., expression), but how can they help us with questioning, reorienting, analyzing, and developing ideas (i.e., critical thinking)? There are many different definitions of critical thinking: “the propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism” (McPeck, 2016), “reasonable, reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do” (Ennis, 1993), and “the development and evaluation of arguments” (Facione, 1984). Critical thinking requires many dispositions, such as seeking clear statements of questions, looking for alternatives, and being open-minded (Ennis, 1987).\n\nCritical thinking is what makes many areas of intellectual inquiry – such as history, science, and philosophy – difficult. For instance, on different accounts, history requires interpreting the past with alternative (nonlinear, long-range) temporalities (Braudel, 2023), taking into account the ways in which power structures shape historical record (Foucault, 1995; Trouillot, 1995), and identifying and manipulating narrative structures (White, 1975; Gaddis, 2004). Science requires advances not only in empirical work, but also in the underlying paradigms of research (Kuhn & Hawkins, 1963) and navigation of a variety of social, technical, and material factors (Latour, 1989).\n\nA limited body of work has explored how LMs might contribute towards human critical thinking. Cai et al. (2024) consider how currently “sycophantic,” “servile,” and “lobotomized” LMs can be used in more critical ways by challenging users’ pre-existing ideas and constructively using antagonistic interactions to develop their thinking. Park & Kulkarni (2024) show how LMs as “thinking assistants” can facilitate human reflection by asking, instead of answering, questions."

            "text": "In this paper, we focus on philosophy as a case study for critical thinking. Philosophy is concerned with critical, systematic, and reflective examination of the world. This includes understanding the basic structure of life and the world – what does it mean to exist (Aristotle, 1908; Heidegger, 1962; Sartre, 1993), live (Aurelius, 2006), and die (Kierkegaard, 1983; Nietzsche, 1961); what does it mean to know something (Plato, 2008b; Kant, 2003; Husserl, 1977) and what are the limits of scientific knowledge (Popper, 2002; Chalmers, 2013); on what moral bases should we act (Aristotle, 2004; Spinoza, 2003), and is it even possible to determine ‘objective’ answers to moral questions (Hume, 2003; Harman & Thomson, 1996)? Core to philosophy is “the endeavour to know how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead of legitimating what is already known” (Foucault & Hurley, 1990). In thinking about how to think, philosophy is not only about suspicion toward the meanings and functions of various phenomena, but also recovery of new significances, meanings, and coherence (Ricoeur & Thompson, 1981). Contrary to the image that philosophy is “done in the armchair”, isolated and impractical, philosophy has always been intertwined with other lines of inquiry. Plato engaged extensively with advanced mathematics; Aristotle contributed to early physics; Hume leaned on psychology. Philosophy has asked and continues to ask urgent, relevant questions: how are we to understand “fairness” and “justice” in algorithmic discrimination (Hu, 2023), legal punishment (Alexander, 1922), and the distribution of resources (Rawls, 1971); quantum mechanics in physics (Carnap, 1966); the relationship between consciousness and the brain in neuroscience (Chalmers, 2013)? Indeed, researchers in every area of intellectual inquiry confront philosophical questions in their work: they might ask if a model or concept is “really real” and how they know so, or aim to formulate normative desiderata for theories."

            "text": "We use the two broad reasons why LMs fail to be good critical thinking tools in §4 as the basis for the model’s two axes: they have low initiative, as they are servile, passive, and incurious. \n\nInitiative is a resource’s ability to set its own intentions and goals, possibly different from its user’s, and to execute actions oriented towards those intentions. High-direction resources are not strictly or existentially bound to their user’s directives, and may deviate from them. Current LMs exhibit low initiative (§4.3). \n\nThese two axes form the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, and explain why philosophers find texts and other people (but not LMs) to be useful tools. Our model further provides a design space for LMs as critical thinking tools. \n\n###figure_1### Why do philosophers find other people and texts to be useful critical thinking tools? In the selfhood-initiative model, other people are variable-initiative tools. People have specific backgrounds and experiences which inform their views, perspectives, and beliefs; these influence how they understand and respond. Philosophers find value in talking to other people; they expect that they will receive interesting judgements and comments, rather than placid neutrality. However, these people may have variable initiative, depending on the situation. In free-flowing conversation, each interlocutor may carry the conversation in some direction, whereas in a more focused conversation aimed at collecting feedback, an interlocutor may be expected to directly respond to one’s ideas and requests without their own intellectual initiative. \n\nMeanwhile, in the selfhood-initiative model, texts are high-initiative, variable-selfhood tools. Texts are not themselves responsive to a user’s intentions (Plato, 2008a); they express the author’s attempt to fulfill their intentions, and one encounters the product of this attempt after the fact of its production. This exteriority from the user allows the user to reflect upon similarities and differences between their own thinking and the tool’s outputs. On the other hand, the way in which texts are written can vary in the degree of selfhood they express. \n\nInformative, survey-based, and clarificatory papers tend to de-emphasize an author’s perspectives and opinions, whereas more explicitly argumentative papers may center them; both can be useful to philosophers in different ways. \n\nWhy don’t philosophers find current LMs to be useful critical thinking tools? In the selfhood-initiative model, current LMs are low-selfhood, low-initiative tools. They do not provide philosophers with particular concrete perspectives into the problem space, nor do they provide ideas sufficiently exterior to a philosopher’s own thinking to allow for meaningful reflection and connections. These properties make LMs particularly useful for alternative modes of thought, such as carrying out rote and well-defined tasks and helping rewrite sentences, but hamper critical thinking."

As a role for LMs, this would involve making judgments and taking positions based on its perspectives. It would challenge or disagree with what users say and respond or modify its beliefs if users make reasonable points. It would ask its own questions in pursuit of its interests, and refuse or redirect certain lines of inquiry in favor of others. Drawing upon persistent memories and beliefs across sessions to produce ideas, it might be charitable and polite, like colleagues, while resisting a servile and sycophantic dynamic. \n\nWhen developing ideas, philosophers encounter various decision points at which they use certain approaches over others. Many suggest it is important to become more aware of the choices at these decision points. Without such awareness, philosophers expose their ideas to imprecision and objections, potentially reproducing biases and metaphilosophical problems. As a role for LMs, it would act as a “checks and balances” on philosophizing, providing a variety of ideas and resources. It functions similarly to survey texts, illustrating different approaches and helping philosophers situate their ideas. Its suggestions may or may not be directly relevant but act as guides. It may ask methodological questions aimed at clarifying philosophers’ decisions.\n\nAs philosophers develop their ideas, they want to understand how others might react, gaining insight into possible misinterpretations, objections, and clarification questions. Interactions can inform how philosophers formulate and present ideas, anticipating objections and strengthening the appeal and utility of their work. It can be counterfactually helpful: if an agent representing an unsavory position resonates with a philosopher’s argument, it might lead the philosopher to reconsider expression, not only defending but delimiting the argument's scope."

            "text": "In addition to modeling challenges, there are several interaction design challenges when developing LMs for critical thinking.\nFirst, philosophers tend to highly value thinking through things themselves; many emphasize that the intellectually substantive parts of philosophy cannot be naively ‘accelerated’ (P1, P7, P14, P17).\nPhilosophers find the process of thinking to be intrinsically valuable, even when it does not produce obvious payoffs (P3, P6, P8) – a feature common to other areas of critical thinking.\nAdditionally, philosophers may feel that authorship of ideas requires that the ideas be ‘mine’, and that ‘I’ should be responsible for making the important intellectual judgments (P4, P10, P18).\nSecondly, it can be difficult and even disruptive to put ideas into words.\nAlthough professional philosophy is mainly formally done in language, the process of thinking through ideas can involve many other dimensions of representation and thinking (P2, P3, P4, P5).\nAmong other challenges, philosophers cite the apparent incongruence between ideas and language as a source of significant burden in learning how to effectively use LMs (P8, P21).\nThis may be true for many other areas of critical thinking.\nThirdly, philosophers find that human connection is enjoyable and important.\nBesides giving rise to unexpected philosophical connections and ideas (P6), conversation with another human is deeply enjoyable and fulfilling, on its own merits (P8, P21).\nMoreover, some philosophers feel that serious philosophical inquiry requires some kind of subjectivity or lived experience (P6, P8, P16).\nTherefore, LMs will need to coexist with and enrich, rather than seek to replace, the ecosystem of human and textual resources already available to philosophers and other professional critical thinkers."

            "text": "In his masterwork Jerusalem, Moses Mendelssohn criticizes the predominant use of dead forms of interaction, which he believes inhibit innovation: “We teach and instruct one another only through writings; we learn to know nature and human only from writings. We work and relax, edify and amuse ourselves through scribbling…” (Mendelssohn, 1983  ###reference_b57###, 41).\n\nInstead, Mendelssohn advocates for a living script, “arousing the mind and heart, full of meaning, continuously inspiring thought”. This living script encourages engagement with tools that inspire and support critical thinking. As technologies for reading and writing, these living scripts can offer critical thinkers a wider and more accessible set of ways to support the development of ideas and to shape disciplinary practices and cultures."
