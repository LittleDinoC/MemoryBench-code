    "abstract": "We introduce a decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, for large language models, which consists of two components, i.e., a cross-decoder stacked upon a self-decoder. The self-decoder efficiently encodes global key-value (KV) caches that are reused by the cross-decoder via cross-attention. The overall model behaves like a decoder-only Transformer. The design retains global attention capability. Additionally, the computation flow enables prefilling to early exit without changing the final output, thereby significantly speeding up the prefill stage. Experimental results demonstrate that YOCO achieves favorable performance compared to Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and number of training tokens. We also extend YOCO to 1M context length with near-perfect needle retrieval accuracy. Code is available at https://aka.ms/YOCO.",

            "text": "The decoder-only Transformer has become the de facto architecture for language models. Numerous efforts have continued to develop suitable architectures for language modeling. There have been main strands of explorations. First, encoder-only language models, such as BERT, bidirectionally encode the input sequence. Second, encoder-decoder models, such as T5, use a bidirectional encoder to encode input and a unidirectional decoder to generate output. Both of the above layouts struggle with autoregressive generation due to bidirectionality. Specifically, encoders have to encode the whole input and output tokens again for the next generation step. Although encoder-decoder can use only the decoder to generate, the output tokens do not fully leverage the parameters of the encoder, especially for multi-turn conversation. Third, decoder-only language models, such as GPT, generate tokens autoregressively.\n\nIn this work, we propose a decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, for large language models. Specifically, we stack cross-decoder upon self-decoder. Given an input sequence, the self-decoder utilizes efficient self-attention. Then the cross-decoder layers employ cross-attention. The decoder-decoder architecture is conceptually similar to encoder-decoder, but the whole model behaves more like a decoder-only model from the external view. So, it naturally fits into autoregressive generation tasks, such as language modeling.\n\nSecond, the computation flow of the decoder-decoder architecture enables prefilling to early exit before entering the self-decoder. This property speeds up the prefill stage dramatically, improving user experience for long-context language models. Third, YOCO allows for more efficient system design for distributed long-sequence training. In addition, we propose gated retention for self-decoder, which augments retention with a data-controlled gating mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments to show that YOCO achieves favorable language modeling performance and has many advantages in terms of inference efficiency.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that YOCO can be scaled up with more training tokens, larger model size, and longer context length. Specifically, we scale up the 3B YOCO model to trillions of training tokens, attaining results on par with prominent Transformer language models, such as StableLM. Moreover, the scaling curves ranging from 160M to 13B show that YOCO is competitive compared to Transformer. We also extend the context length of YOCO to 1M tokens, achieving near-perfect needle retrieval accuracy. In the multi-needle test, YOCO obtains competitive results even compared to larger Transformers.\n\nIn addition to good performance on various tasks, the profiling results show that YOCO improves the prefill latency, throughput, and serving capacity. The prefill stage is speeded up, for example, reducing the Transformer prefilling latency for a 512K context from 180 seconds to less than six seconds. The results position YOCO as a strong candidate model architecture for future large language models with native long-sequence support."

As shown in Figure 2, the decoder-decoder architecture has two parts, i.e., self-decoder and cross-decoder. Specifically, YOCO is stacked with blocks, where the first layers are self-decoder while the rest modules are cross-decoder. Given an input sequence, the input embeddings are packed into , where is hidden dimension. We first obtain contextualized vector representations , where is used to produce outputs. Then we compute to get the output vectors . Both self- and cross-decoder follow a similar block layout (i.e., interleaved attention and feed-forward network) as in Transformer. We also include pre-RMSNorm, SwiGLU, and grouped-query attention as improvements. The difference between the two parts lies in attention modules. Self-decoder uses efficient self-attention (e.g., sliding-window attention). In comparison, cross-decoder uses global cross-attention to attend to the shared representations produced by the output of the self-decoder."

As shown in Table 3, because the cross-decoder reuses the outputs of the self-decoder, we can exit early before entering the cross-decoder during the prefill stage. The intriguing property of computation dependency greatly accelerates the prefilling speed. First, only half the layers are needed for forward computation, i.e., at least half prefilling latency reduction. Second, the efficient attention modules of the self-decoder are usually fast. For the example of 512K context length, we can decrease the prefilling latency from 180 seconds (Transformer with optimized inference, such as Flash-Decoding and kernel fusion) to less than 6 seconds. Even for 32K length, YOCO has about three times speedup in terms of prefilling time. Table 3 compares prefilling time complexity of attention modules between Transformer and YOCO."

The sliding window size of YOCO is 1,024. We align the number of parameters by adjusting the FFN intermediate dimension. The training batch size is 0.25M tokens with a 2k sequence length.

YOCO obtains comparable performance from 160M to 13B compared to the Llama-optimized transformer architecture. The findings demonstrate that YOCO scales effectively with respect to model size. Moreover, YOCO outperforms Transformer and YOCO. The gains come from hybrid architectures of attention and retention, whose inductive biases tend to be complementary to each other.

We continue the model training with longer lengths progressively. The length schedule is 64K, 256K, and 1M tokens. The batch size is kept the same as before. The learning rate and RoPE are set as in Table 8. Training data is up-sampled according to sequence length. For a fair comparison, we do not use long-instruction tuning data. More training details are described in Appendix E.\n\nThe pressure test evaluates whether models can retrieve “needles” from a long document. We follow the evaluation setting of Gemini 1.5 and LWM. The needles are constructed as a city with a magic number. We run 10 times at the same depth and length. The averaged accuracy is reported. Figure 4 shows that YOCO-3B-1M passes the Needle-In-A-Haystack test with near perfect accuracy. The results indicate that YOCO has strong long-context modeling capability.\n\nMulti-Needle Retrieval  \nBesides the above single-needle retrieval, we conduct a multi-needle evaluation. We compare YOCO-3B-1M with previous long-context language models, including MiniCPM-128K, ChatGLM3-128K, YaRN-Mistral-128K, and LWM-1M-text. The evaluation is conducted in 128K sequence length, because most previous models are tuned with this length. Table 5 reports the accuracy with needles. Among these models, LWM-1M-text and YOCO-3B-1M are trained with a 1M context length, while the others are in 128K length. Although LWM-1M-text continues training of Llama-2-7B, YOCO-3B-1M can still achieve comparable performance with half the model size. Moreover, the 7B-size YaRN-Mistral-128K obtained by position interpolation lags behind the other models. Compared to MiniCPM-128K and ChatGLM3-128K, YOCO-3B-1M also outperforms these well-trained language models.\n\nPerplexity over Long Sequences  \nFigure 5 shows the cumulative average negative log-likelihood (NLL) as a function of context length. We evaluate both book and repository-level code data. We follow the setting of [27] and filter validation data that are longer than 1M tokens. NLL decreases consistently with longer sequence length. The results indicate that YOCO can effectively utilize long-distance dependency for language modeling. We also observe that the NLL-length curves tend to fit the power law, where the gaps are affected by the noise within the validation examples."

We demonstrate that YOCO reduces the deployment cost by orders of magnitude, especially for long-sequence inference. More importantly, the user experience (such as latency) is improved while maintaining good performance and reducing expenses. We compare YOCO with Transformer. The default model configuration follows Section 4.1 ###reference_###. Notice that Transformer uses grouped-query attention [2 ###reference_b2###], Flash-Decoding [8 ###reference_b8###], and kernel fusion for a fair comparison. As described in Section 3.1 ###reference_###, gated retention uses the chunk-recurrent representation in the prefill stage, and the recurrent representation in the generation stage. The chunk size is set to 256. We implement a Triton [33 ###reference_b33###] kernel for gated retention. The evaluation sequence length is ranging from 32K to 1M. The last 1,024 tokens are supposed to be generated, while the previous tokens are given input context. The experiments are conducted with H100-80GB GPU cards.\n\nPrefilling Latency  \nIn the prefill stage, the model encodes input tokens in parallel. As shown in Figure 8 ###reference_###, the prefilling latency is a pain point of user experience for long-context models. For 512K- and 1M-length input sequences, Transformer needs about 180 seconds and 300 seconds, respectively. The computational complexity of Transformer is , which requires a large number of FLOPs for long context. In contrast, YOCO’s prefilling time is , growing linearly (Section 2.3 ###reference_###) along the sequence length. Figure 8 ###reference_### shows that YOCO reduces the Transformer prefilling time from 180 seconds to less than 6 seconds for 512K context. As described in Section 2.3 ###reference_###, the prefill stage can early exit before entering cross-decoder. So, there is at least two times speedup of prefilling latency even for short context. For example, YOCO is faster than Transformer for 32K length.\n\nThroughput  \nThe throughput indicates how many tokens the model can process per second, involving both pre-filling and generation time. Figure 9 ###reference_### shows that YOCO achieves higher throughput across context lengths compared to Transformer. For the example of 512K queries, Transformer’s throughput is 4.5 token/s while YOCO reaches 43.1 token/s, i.e, achieving speedup. The throughput is improved for the following reasons. First, YOCO decreases the time required for prefilling as previously demonstrated. Second, as the memory consumption is reduced, we can use larger batch size for inference, which also contributes to the throughput improvement."

Profiling results also show that YOCO improves inference efficiency by orders of magnitude, especially for long-sequence modeling.\n\nThe work can be advanced from the following perspectives:\n\nYOCO + BitNet + Groq. Groq achieves very high throughput by putting all things within SRAM. The memory capacity bottleneck limits the model size and input token count. Hundreds of chips are connected to host just one model. BitNet reduces model weight memory. The LLM deployment cost is expected to be reduced by orders of magnitude using the above combination.\n\nYOCO for Multimodal Large Language Models. The YOCO layout is general to the use of multiple self-decoders. The cross-attention layers are natural for multimodal fusion. The causal dependency of self-decoders also perfectly fits in streaming video. The async multimodal large language models can avoid different data streams blocking each other, which is critical for real-time applications, such as robotics."
