    "abstract": "The needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which examines the ability to retrieve a piece of information (the “needle”) from long distractor texts (the “haystack”), has been widely adopted to evaluate long-context language models (LMs). However, this simple retrieval-based test is indicative of only a superficial form of long-context understanding. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs, we create a new synthetic benchmark Ruler with flexible configurations for customized sequence length and task complexity. Ruler expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diverse types and quantities of needles. Moreover, Ruler introduces new task categories multi-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching from context. We evaluate ten long-context LMs with 13 representative tasks in Ruler. Despite achieving nearly perfect accuracy in the vanilla NIAH test, all models exhibit large performance drops as the context length increases. While these models all claim context sizes of 32K tokens or greater, only four models (GPT-4, Command-R, Yi-34B, and Mixtral) can maintain satisfactory performance at the length of 32K. Our analysis of Yi-34B, which supports context length of 200K, reveals large room for improvement  as we increase input length and task complexity. We open source Ruler to spur comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs. ††* Authors contributed equally.",

            "text": "Recent advancements in AI system engineering (Dao et al., 2022  ###reference_b14###; Jacobs et al., 2023  ###reference_b28###; Fu et al., 2024  ###reference_b21###) and language model designs (Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b9###; Xiong et al., 2023  ###reference_b75###) have enabled efficient scaling up of context length for language models (Liu et al., 2024a  ###reference_b39###; Young et al., 2024  ###reference_b78###). Previous works (AI21, 2024  ###reference_b1###; X.AI, 2024  ###reference_b72###; Reid et al., 2024  ###reference_b53###; Anthropic, 2024  ###reference_b4###) commonly adopt synthetic tasks, such as passkey retrieval (Mohtashami & Jaggi, 2023  ###reference_b44###) and needle-in-a-haystack (Kamradt, 2023  ###reference_b32###) to evaluate long-context LMs. However, these evaluations are used inconsistently across works and reveal merely the retrieval capability, failing to gauge other forms of long-context understanding.\nIn this work, we propose Ruler, a new benchmark to evaluate long-context modeling capabilities for language models.\nRuler contains four task categories to test behaviors (Ribeiro et al., 2020  ###reference_b54###) beyond simple retrieval from context:\nRetrieval: we extend the needle-in-a-haystack (Kamradt, 2023  ###reference_b32###, NIAH) test to evaluate retrieval capability with diverse types and quantities of needles.\nMulti-hop Tracing: we propose variable tracking, a minimal proxy task for coreference chain resolution to check the behavior of tracing entities with multi-hop connections.\nAggregation: we propose common/frequent words extraction, proxy tasks for summarization to test the ability to aggregate relevant information that spans long-range context.\nQuestion Answering: we add distracting information to the input of existing short-context QA datasets to evaluate question answering capability at various context sizes.\nCompared to existing realistic benchmarks (Table 1  ###reference_###), Ruler consists solely of synthetic tasks, which offer the flexibility to control sequence length and task complexity.\nThe synthetic input in Ruler reduces reliance on parametric knowledge, which interferes with the utilization of long-context input in realistic tasks (Shaham et al., 2023  ###reference_b55###; Bai et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###).\nUsing Ruler, we benchmark GPT-4  (OpenAI: Josh Achiam et al., 2023  ###reference_b47###) and nine open-source models with context length ranging from 4k to 128k. Despite achieving nearly perfect performance on the vanilla NIAH test, all models exhibit large degradation on more complex tasks in Ruler as sequence length increases. While all models claim context size of 32k tokens or greater, our results indicate that only four of them can effectively handle sequence length of 32K by exceeding a qualitative threshold. Moreover, almost all models fall below the threshold before reaching the claimed context lengths.\nTo obtain fine-grained model comparisons, we aggregate performance from 4k to 128k with two weighted average scores where the weights simulate the length distribution of real-world use cases. The top models - GPT-4, Command-R (Cohere, 2024  ###reference_b12###), Yi-34B (Young et al., 2024  ###reference_b78###), and Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024  ###reference_b30###), consistently outperform other models regardless of the chosen weighting scheme.\nWe further analyze Yi-34B, which claims context length of 200K and achieves the 2nd place on Ruler among open-source models. Our results demonstrate large degradation in Yi’s performance as we increase input length and task complexity. At large context sizes, Yi-34B often returns incomplete answers and fails to precisely locate the relevant information. Furthermore, we observe two behaviors emerging with the scaling of context size across multiple models: the increased reliance on parametric knowledge and the increased tendency to copy from context for non-retrieval tasks. Our additional ablations demonstrate that training on longer sequences does not always lead to better performance on Ruler, and that larger model sizes positively correlate with better long-context capabilities. Finally, we show that non-Transformer architectures, such as RWKV and Mamba, still lag behind Transformer by large margins on Ruler.\nOur contributions are as follows:\nWe propose a new benchmark Ruler for evaluating long-context language models via synthetic tasks with flexible configurations.\nWe introduce new task categories, specifically multi-hop tracing and aggregation, to test behaviors other than retrieval from long context.\nWe evaluate ten long-context LMs using Ruler and perform analysis across models and task complexities.\nWe open source Ruler to spur future research in long-context language models.111https://github.com/hsiehjackson/RULER  ###reference_###"

            "text": "Numerous long-context language models have been introduced lately owing to the progress in engineering, architectural, and algorithmic designs. Flash attention (Dao et al., 2022  ###reference_b14###; Dao, 2023  ###reference_b13###) and Ring attention (Liu et al., 2023  ###reference_b38###) significantly reduce the memory footprint required for processing long context. Various sparse attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019  ###reference_b11###; Jaszczur et al., 2021  ###reference_b29###) such as shifted sparse attention (Chen et al., 2024  ###reference_b10###), dilated attention (Ding et al., 2023  ###reference_b15###), and attention sinks (Han et al., 2023  ###reference_b25###; Xiao et al., 2024b  ###reference_b74###) were employed to enable efficient context scaling. Novel position embedding methods were proposed to improve length extrapolation in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017  ###reference_b68###), including ALiBi (Press et al., 2022  ###reference_b51###), xPOS (Sun et al., 2023b  ###reference_b59###), and RoPE (Su et al., 2023  ###reference_b56###) variants (Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b9###; Xiong et al., 2023  ###reference_b75###; Peng et al., 2024  ###reference_b49###; Liu et al., 2024b  ###reference_b40###; Ding et al., 2024  ###reference_b16###; Zhu et al., 2024  ###reference_b81###). Another line of research focuses on reducing context size. This can be achieved by caching previous context using recurrence mechanism (Zhang et al., 2024a  ###reference_b79###; Bulatov et al., 2023  ###reference_b7###; Martins et al., 2022  ###reference_b42###; Wu et al., 2022  ###reference_b71###), or preserving only the salient information within long context via retrieval (Xu et al., 2024  ###reference_b76###; Mohtashami & Jaggi, 2023  ###reference_b44###; Wang et al., 2024  ###reference_b69###; Tworkowski et al., 2024  ###reference_b66###; Xiao et al., 2024a  ###reference_b73###) or compression (Jiang et al., 2023  ###reference_b31###). Finally, novel architectures (Gu et al., 2022  ###reference_b24###; Fu et al., 2023a  ###reference_b19###; Poli et al., 2023  ###reference_b50###; Fu et al., 2023b  ###reference_b20###; Sun et al., 2023a  ###reference_b58###) such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023  ###reference_b23###) and RWKV (Peng et al., 2023  ###reference_b48###) have also been proposed to efficiently handle long-context input.\nOur work is closely related to other works on benchmarking long-context language models. ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023  ###reference_b55###) covers ten realistic natural language tasks, such as long-document QA and (query-based) summarization. L-Eval (An et al., 2024  ###reference_b2###) also uses realistic data, which was filtered manually to ensure quality. LongBench (Bai et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###) contains tasks in a bilingual setting. InfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024b  ###reference_b80###) includes tasks with length greater than 100K tokens. LTM (Castillo et al., 2024  ###reference_b8###) targets the evaluation of long-term conversations. To isolate the effect of parametric knowledge, previous works (Dong et al., 2023  ###reference_b17###; Li et al., 2023b  ###reference_b37###) also propose to use documents posted online later than a certain cutoff date, or leverage extremely low-resource materials (Tanzer et al., 2024  ###reference_b60###).\nCompared to realistic benchmarks, synthetic tasks are more flexible to control the setup (e.g., sequence length and task complexity) and less affected by parametric knowledge. Recent works have mostly focused on retrieval-based synthetic tasks(Kamradt, 2023  ###reference_b32###; Mohtashami & Jaggi, 2023  ###reference_b44###; Li et al., 2023a  ###reference_b36###; Liu et al., 2024c  ###reference_b41###), with a few on other types of long-context usage, including various types of reasoning (Tay et al., 2021  ###reference_b61###) and long-range discourse modeling (Sun et al., 2022  ###reference_b57###)."

            "text": "Recent works (Reid et al., 2024  ###reference_b53###; Anthropic, 2023  ###reference_b3###) commonly employ the needle-in-a-haystack (Kamradt, 2023  ###reference_b32###, NIAH) test to evaluate long-context modeling capability. The NIAH test is reminiscent of the extensively studied (Hopfield, 1982  ###reference_b26###; Graves et al., 2014  ###reference_b22###; Olsson et al., 2022  ###reference_b46###; Arora et al., 2024  ###reference_b5###) associative recall tasks, in which relevant information needs to be retrieved from context given a sufficient query. In Ruler, we include multiple retrieval-based tasks, extending the vanilla NIAH test to evaluate models based on three criteria. Concretely, the retrieval capability should be (1) agnostic to the type of the “needle” and the “haystack”, (2) strong enough to disregard hard distractors, and (3) of high recall when multiple items need to be retrieved. Based on these criteria, we develop four NIAH tasks. The “needle” in each of these tasks is a key-value pair inserted into the “haystack” (long distractor texts). The query is located at the end of the sequence and serves as a cue for matching the keys in the context and subsequently retrieving the associated values.\nSingle NIAH (S-NIAH):  This is the vanilla NIAH test where a single “needle”222Similar to Liu et al. (2024a  ###reference_b39###), we use “the special magic number for XXX is: YYY” as the needle due to its extendability instead of the sentence about San Francisco proposed by Kamradt (2023  ###reference_b32###). needs to be retrieved from the “haystack”.\nThe query/key/value can take the form of words, numbers (7 digits), or UUIDs (32 digits). The “haystack” can be repeated noise sentences333 Following Mohtashami & Jaggi (2023  ###reference_b44###), we use “The grass is green. The sky is blue. The sun is yellow. Here we go. There and back again.” as noise sentences. or Paul Graham essays (Kamradt, 2023  ###reference_b32###).\nMulti-keys NIAH (MK-NIAH):  Multiple “needles” are inserted into the “haystack”, and only one of them needs to be retrieved. The additional “needles” are hard distractors. The most challenging setting is a version where the “haystack” is filled with distractor needles.\nMulti-values NIAH (MV-NIAH):  Multiple “needles” sharing the same key are inserted into the “haystack”. All values associated with the same key need to be retrieved.\nMulti-queries NIAH (MQ-NIAH):  Multiple “needles” are inserted into the “haystack”. All “needles” with distinct keys need to be retrieved. This is the same multi-query associative recall task setup used by Arora et al. (2024  ###reference_b5###). Together with MV-NIAH, these two tasks evaluate the retrieval capability without missing any critical information."

We develop a new task variable tracking to emulate a minimal coreference chain resolution (Ng, 2010  ###reference_b45###) task. This task checks the behavior of tracking relevant co-occurrence patterns and drawing skipped connections within long input. Specifically, a variable  is initialized with a value , followed by a linear chain of variable name binding statements (e.g., ), which are inserted at various positions of the input. The objective is to return all variable names pointing to the same value . The task complexity can be increased by adding more hops (i.e., the times of name binding) or more chains, similar to adding hard distractors in MK-NIAH."

Complete information about these models is included in Appendix A  ###reference_###. We evaluate all models using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023  ###reference_b35###), an LLM serving system with efficient KV cache memory management. For all models, we run the inference in BFloat16 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with greedy decoding.\nWe test all models on 13 tasks ranging diverse complexities from the four categories of Ruler.\nThe test configurations have been selected (shown in Appendix B  ###reference_###) based on a task correlational study described in Appendix C  ###reference_###.\nFor each task, we evaluate each model with 500 examples generated for each length from the series (4k, 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k, 128k), while complying with each model’s necessary chat template.555See Appendix D  ###reference_### for model and tasks templates details.\nTo prevent the model from refusing to answer a query or generating explanations, we append the task input with an answer prefix and check the presence of the target output with recall-based accuracy.\nWe notice large performance degradation in all models as we increase input length in Ruler. To determine the maximum context size a model can effectively handle, we grade each model with a fixed threshold, passing which indicates satisfactory performance at the length of evaluation. We use the performance of Llama2-7b model at the 4K context length as the threshold.\nWe report in Table 3  ###reference_### the maximum length exceeding the threshold as the “effective length” along with the “claimed length”.\nWhile the threshold-based grading reveals the discrepancy between claimed and effective length, it lacks details for fine-grained model comparisons. As such, we use a weighted average score to aggregate model performance across various context sizes. We rank models under two weighting schemes: wAvg. (inc) and wAvg. (dec) where the weight linearly increases and decreases with sequence length respectively. Ideally, the weight for each length should be determined by the length distribution of model usage, here we choose the two schemes to simulate the scenarios where longer sequences (inc) or shorter sequences (dec) dominate the distribution.\nWe include the results of ten long-context LMs in comparison with the Llama2-7B baseline in Table 3  ###reference_###.666Performance of base models and breakdown by task categories can be found in Appendix F  ###reference_###.\nThe performance at a certain length is the average of all 13 tasks in Ruler. While these models all claim effective context of 32K tokens or greater, none of them maintains performance above the Llama2-7B baseline at their claimed length, except for Mixtral, which achieves moderate performance on length doubling the claimed 32K context size. Despite achieving nearly perfect performance on the\npasskey retrieval and the vanilla NIAH task (shown in Appendix E  ###reference_###), all models exhibit large degradation in RULER as sequence length increases. The best performant model on Ruler is GPT-4, which has the highest performance at length of 4k and demonstrates the least but non-marginal degradation (15.4) when extending the context to 128K. The top three ranked open-source models, Command-R, Yi-34B and Mixtral, all use a large base frequency in RoPE and are larger in parameter size than other models.\nDespite having been trained with context size of 1M, the LWM performs worse than Llama2-7B even at 4K. However, it shows smaller degradation with the increase of context size, therefore achieves higher rank than Mistral-7B when longer sequences receive larger weight (wAvg. inc). This result suggests a trade-off in evaluation between absolute performance on short sequences and the relative degradation with the scaling of context size."

We evaluate the suite of LargeWorldModels (Liu et al., 2024a  ###reference_b39###, LWM) of equal parameter size and trained up to various context lengths. Figure 4  ###reference_### (left & middle-left) shows that larger context sizes overall lead to better performance, but the ranking can be inconsistent for long sequences. For instance, the model trained with 1M context size (LWM-1M) is worse than the one with 512K at length of 256K, likely due to insufficient training for adjusting to the new base frequency in RoPE. Moreover, we observe abrupt performance drops when models need to extrapolate to unseen lengths (e.g., LMW-128K given input of 256K), and almost linear degradation with input length on log scale within the max training context size.\nThe top models in our main results are much larger than other models. To ablate the effect of model size, we evaluate Yi-34B-200k, Yi-9B-200k, and Yi-6B-200k, all trained up to the same context length using the same data blend. Figure 4  ###reference_### (middle-right) shows that the 34B model is significantly better than the 6B model on Ruler for both performance at length of 4K and the relative degradation, suggesting the benefit of scaling model sizes for better long-context modeling.\nWe evaluate the effective context length for two models with non-Transformer architectures: RWKV-v5 (Peng et al., 2023  ###reference_b48###) and Mamba-2.8B-slimpj (Gu & Dao, 2023  ###reference_b23###).
