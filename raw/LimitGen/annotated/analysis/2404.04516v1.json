    "title": "Language Models as Critical Thinking Tools: A Case Study of Philosophers",
    "abstract": "Current work in language models (LMs) helps us speed up or even skip thinking by accelerating and automating cognitive work.\nBut can LMs help us with critical thinking – thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts?\nWe treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking, and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs.\nWe find that philosophers do not find LMs to be useful because they lack a sense of selfhood (memory, beliefs, consistency) and initiative (curiosity, proactivity). We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools to characterize this gap.\nUsing the model, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent.\nWe hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other ‘critical thinkers’ to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs.",

I want sin.” — “In fact,” says the Controller, “you’re claiming the right to be unhappy … the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; … the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.”\nThere is a long silence.\n“I claim them all,” says John at last.  (Minimally adapted from Huxley (2006  ###reference_b42###).)\nLanguage Models (LMs) have recently alleviated a whole host of our intellectual inconveniences.\nThey can help us do things we would have begrudgingly done by ourselves otherwise: write code (Chen et al., 2021  ###reference_b18###; Rozière et al., 2024  ###reference_b72###), generate emails  (Goodman et al., 2022  ###reference_b33###), and translate text  (Costa-jussà et al., 2022  ###reference_b19###).\nIn sparking ideas by generating stories (Schwitzgebel et al., 2023  ###reference_b76###) and concept designs (Ma et al., 2023  ###reference_b55###), LMs offer shortcuts to gaining new thoughts.\nThey also help us put our thinking into words by revising (Mysore et al., 2023  ###reference_b62###) and giving feedback (Liang et al., 2023  ###reference_b53###) on our writing.\nIn all these cases, LMs help us speed up and circumvent the inconveniences of thinking ourselves.\nIn many contexts, however, the “inconvenience” of thinking is not a temporary problem to be alleviated, but a deep puzzle to be reflected upon.\nMany people are invested in specific areas of intellectual inquiry – e.g., historians, scientists, philosophers – and more generally, in reflection and engagement with the world – e.g., as informed political citizens, critical consumers of media, and moral actors.\nThey are interested in identifying and challenging assumptions, clarifying muddled ideas, and engineering new and useful ways to think.\nCore to this sort of inquiry is critical thinking – “the propensity and skill to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism” (McPeck, 2016  ###reference_b56###).\nCan LMs serve as tools for critical thinking – helping us think more deeply and in more complex ways, rather than faster or not at all?\nWhat if – like John – we claim all the rights to think?\nTo investigate how LMs can serve as critical thinking tools, we use philosophers as a case study – philosophers being people who are in the business of thinking critically about a wide range of concepts and ideas.\nWe interview 21 professional philosophers to understand their thinking processes, collect their experiences with and views on current LMs, and brainstorm the roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools in philosophy (§3  ###reference_###).\nWe find that current philosophers do not think LMs are good critical thinking tools (§4  ###reference_###) for two primary reasons: LMs are too neutral, detached, and nonjudgmental (§4.2  ###reference_###); and LMs are too servile, passive, and incurious (§4.3  ###reference_###).\nWe propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, which explains why philosophers find conversations with other philosophers and reading philosophical texts to be more helpful for their work than current LMs (§5.1  ###reference_###).\nUsing the model, we describe three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent (§5.2  ###reference_###).\nFinally, we outline how these LMs could inform metaphilosophical questions and shape the discipline of philosophy (§6.1  ###reference_###), and discuss challenges in building LMs (§6.2  ###reference_###) and interfaces (§6.3  ###reference_###) for critical thinking."

Science requires advances not only in empirical work, but also in the underlying paradigms of research (Kuhn & Hawkins, 1963  ###reference_b50###) and navigation of a variety of social, technical, and material factors (Latour, 1989  ###reference_b51###).\nA limited body of work has explored how LMs might contribute towards human critical thinking.\nRodman (2023  ###reference_b71###) suggests that political theorists might use LMs to metacognitively reflect upon their own creative processes and judgments.\nCai et al. (2024  ###reference_b11###) consider how currently “sycophantic”, “servile”, and “lobotimized” LMs can be used in more critical ways by challenging users’ pre-existing ideas and constructively using antagonistic interactions to develop their thinking.\nPark & Kulkarni (2024  ###reference_b65###) show how LMs as “thinking assistants” can facilitate human self-reflection by asking, instead of answering, questions."

Current LMs exhibit low selfhood (§4.2  ###reference_###).\nInitiative is a resource’s ability to set its own intentions and goals, possibly different from its user’s, and to execute actions oriented towards those intentions.\nHigh-direction resources are not strictly or existentially bound to their user’s directives, and may deviate from them.\nCurrent LMs exhibit low initiative (§4.3  ###reference_###).\nThese two axes form the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools, and explain why philosophers find texts and other people (but not LMs) to be useful tools.\nOur model further provides a design space for LMs as critical thinking tools.\n###figure_1### Why do philosophers find other people and texts to be useful critical thinking tools?\nIn the selfhood-initiative model, other people are high-selfhood, variable-initiative tools.\nPeople have specific backgrounds and experiences which inform their views, perspectives, and beliefs; these influence how they understand and respond.\nPhilosophers find value in talking to other people often because of their selfhood; they expect that they will receive interesting judgements and comments, rather than placid neutrality.\nHowever, these people may have variable initiative, depending on the situation.\nIn free-flowing conversation, each interlocutor may carry the conversation in some direction, whereas in a more focused conversation aimed at collecting feedback, an interlocutor may be expected to directly respond to one’s ideas and requests without their own intellectual initiative.\nThe high selfhood of other people is helpful because it provides particular perspectives and ways of looking into the problem space.\nMeanwhile, in the selfhood-initiative model, texts are high-initiative, variable-selfhood tools.\nTexts are not themselves responsive to a user’s intentions (Plato, 2008a  ###reference_b66###); they express the author’s attempt to fulfill their intentions, and one encounters the product of this attempt after the fact of its production.\nThis exteriority from the user allows the user to reflect upon similarities and differences between their own thinking and the tool’s outputs.\nOn the other hand, the way in which texts are written can vary in the degree of selfhood they express.\nInformative, survey-based, and clarificatory papers tend to de-emphasize an author’s perspectives and opinions, whereas more explicitly argumentative papers may center them; both can be useful to philosophers in different ways.\nWhy don’t philosophers find current LMs to be useful critical thinking tools?\nIn the selfhood-initiative model, current LMs are low-selfhood, low-initiative tools.\nThey do not provide philosophers with particular concrete perspectives into the problem space, nor do they provide ideas sufficiently exterior to a philosopher’s own thinking to allow for meaningful reflection and connections.\nThese properties make LMs particularly useful for alternative modes of thought, such as carrying out rote and well-defined tasks and helping rewrite sentences, but hamper critical thinking."

            "text": "According to the selfhood-initiative model, good critical thinking tools should have high selfhood, high initiative, or both.\nFrom our model, we set out three roles of LMs for philosophy – the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent – corresponding to the three viable cells in the selfhood-initiative model (high-selfhood, high-initiative; low-selfhood, high-initiative; high-selfhood; low-initiative)\nThe Interlocutor  high-selfhood, high-initiative.\nPhilosophers mention that they often get their ideas in free-flowing conversation with fellow philosophers or from reading literature making arguments which seem tenuous, incorrect, or incomplete (§4.1  ###reference_###).\nIn the terms of the selfhood-initiative model, these are high-selfhood, high-initiative tools.\nAs a role for LMs, the Interlocutor would invert many of the human-AI relationships taken for granted in current LMs.\nRather than attempting to remain neutral, the Interlocutor makes judgments and takes positions based on its perspectives.\nRather than accommodating and affirming users’ every response, the Interlocutor thinks through and challenges or disagrees with what its users say; it responds or modifies its own beliefs if users make reasonable points.\nRather than remaining passive and answering user questions, the Interlocutor asks its own questions in pursuit of its ‘own’ interests, and refuses or redirects certain lines of inquiry in favor of others.\nRather than being amnesic and detached, the Interlocutor draws upon its persistent memories and beliefs across sessions to produce ideas.\nThe Interlocutor does not need to be strictly antagonistic, as explored in Cai et al. (2024  ###reference_b11###); indeed, it may be charitable and polite, much like colleagues, while at the same time resisting the “servility” and “sycophancy” disrupted by the antagonistic paradigm.\nThe Monitor  low-selfhood, high-initiative.\nWhile developing ideas, philosophers consciously or unconsciously encounter various “decision junctures” at which they use certain approaches or pursue certain ideas over others. (P6).\nMany philosophers suggest that it may be important to reduce, or at least become more aware of, the choices at these decision junctures (P6, P2, P7).\nWithout such awareness, philosophers may expose their ideas to imprecision (‘which path did you exactly take?’) and objections (‘why this path and not others?’); moreover, these choices may reproduce personal and disciplinary biases, reifying metaphilosophical problems (§6.1  ###reference_###).\nAs a role for LMs, the Monitor acts as a “checks and balances” on philosophizing; it is not interested in retaining self-consistency or in expressing particular points of view (low selfhood), but has high initiative to provide a variety of ideas and resources to the user.\nThe Monitor functions similarly to survey texts which provide a ‘lay of the land’, illustrating different approaches and ideas to help philosophers situate their ideas, able to take all sorts of changing sides with the initiative to challenge and confront.\nThe Monitor’s suggestions may or may not be directly relevant to the philosopher’s work, but act as reference guides – to which the philosopher might think, “that’s a related idea, maybe there’s a connection here” or “that doesn’t seem directly related, but it’s good to have in mind”.\nMoreover, the Monitor may ask a variety of uncomfortable and unexpected methodological questions aimed at clarifying philosophers’ decisions.\nThe Respondent  high-selfhood, low-initiative.\nAs philosophers develop their ideas, they want to understand how others might react – better understanding possible misinterpretations, objections, and clarification questions which may arise (P6, P10, P12).\nthese reactions should have high selfhood to be substantive and particular, and low initiative to remain directly focused on the user’s ideas.\nAs a role for LMs, the Respondent adopts a specific set of beliefs and perspectives and reacts directly to the user’s ideas; it does not merely role-play or superficially caricature different positions, but should have consistent memories and beliefs which are reasonably open to change (P4) rather than dogmatically fixed.\nInteractions with the Respondent may inform how the philosopher formulates and presents their ideas; they may anticipate certain objections and strengthen its appeal and utility.\nThe Respondent can also be counterfactually helpful: if an agent representing an unsavory position resonates with a philosopher’s argument, then that philosopher might reconsider how their argument is expressed, not only defending but also delimiting the scope of their argument (P6)."

            "text": "Throughout our interviews, we found that thinking through how LMs can serve as critical thinking tools raises many interesting metaphilosophical questions.\nWhat does it mean to ‘do’ philosophy, and who or what can ‘do’ it?\nHow mechanical or creative is doing philosophy?\nOur findings in §4.1  ###reference_### provide some empirical illumination for these questions.\nPhilosophers found concretely reflecting on these questions – provoked by thinking about LMs’ role in doing philosophy – to be interesting and helpful (P1, P7, P15, P20).\nHowever, LMs may also play a role in actively addressing metaphilosophical problems.\nConsider three concerns about the philosophical method and discipline.\nFirst, Dotson (2012  ###reference_b22###) describes how a “culture of justification”\nresults in the exclusion of diverse forms of philosophical inquiry beyond the canon, such as non-Western philosophy and work from historically marginalized people.\nSecond, Diamond (1982  ###reference_b20###) argues that a myopic focus on formulating convincing arguments against unconvinced listeners overlooks alternative non-argumentative modes of philosophy.\nThird, many philosophers have suggested that the “analytic-continental” distinction in philosophy – a divide which intellectually segregates philosophers, journals, and departments from each other – is not as substantive as it appears (Mizrahi & Dickinson, 2021  ###reference_b60###; Thomson,  ###reference_b83###), counterproductive (Dolcini, 2007  ###reference_b21###), and reconcilable (Levy, 2003  ###reference_b52###; Bell et al., 2016  ###reference_b7###).\nSuppose these accounts as presented are true, and that the phenomena they describe occur not by conscious actions but by neglect and the academic structure (as these accounts suggest).\nThen, LMs may draw philosophers’ attention outside the canon and across the divide as Interlocutors and Monitors, and represent these positions and methodologies as Respondents – possibly more approachably and certainly at larger scale than humans can."

            "text": "If LM researchers are convinced that supporting critical thinking is an interesting and important goal for LMs,\nthen critical thinking may serve as another of many “north stars” LM research, guiding what we want from LMs.\nCorresponding to the limitations of language models discussed in §4.2  ###reference_### and §4.3  ###reference_### are several concrete areas for further LM research.\nLMs will need to become more convincing agents (Andreas, 2022  ###reference_b2###) which can represent specific positions and belief systems (Scherrer et al., 2023  ###reference_b74###; Jin et al., 2024  ###reference_b45###) 3; stay consistent with them (Chen et al., 2021  ###reference_b18###; Zhao et al., 2024  ###reference_b89###) 2; and commit towards and draw from long-term memory (Wang et al., 2023  ###reference_b85###) 4.\nIn particular, LLMs will need to concretely reason about “uncommon sense”  1 2, seriously considering positions which deviate from intuitively true or correct ways of thinking about the world (Ziems et al., 2023  ###reference_b90###; Hendrycks et al., 2023  ###reference_b38###; Bisk et al., 2019  ###reference_b9###).\nThis may require rethinking how we align LMs (Ouyang et al., 2022  ###reference_b64###; Sorensen et al., 2024  ###reference_b79###), given that humans tend to be drawn towards confident common-sense responses (P5).\nLMs will need to improve their long-range planning (Hao et al., 2023  ###reference_b35###) and act autonomously (Händler, 2023  ###reference_b43###)  1, operating in cases where there is no clear algorithm for solving a problem (P4, P3, P8); LMs will need to take effective conceptual risks without clear immediate payoffs (P18) and reason about unsettled and open ideas (P8).\nTo support more diverse forms of interaction beyond question answering or task execution  2, LMs will need to significantly improve in theory of mind (Kosinski, 2024  ###reference_b49###; Jamali et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###).\nLMs need to “understand what’s happening [in the conversation] without it being explicitly said, because.. you haven’t fully expressed it to yourself yet” (P8), which will allow them to focus on the significant rather than irrelevant or obvious paths of inquiry in conversation (P6, P8)."

            "text": "In addition to modeling challenges, there are several interaction design challenges when developing LMs for critical thinking.\nFirst, philosophers tend to highly value thinking through things themselves; many emphasize that the intellectually substantive parts of philosophy cannot be naively ‘accelerated’ (P1, P7, P14, P17).\nPhilosophers find the process of thinking to be intrinsically valuable, even when it does not produce obvious payoffs (P3, P6, P8) – a feature common to other areas of critical thinking.\nAdditionally, philosophers may feel that authorship of ideas requires that the ideas be ‘mine’, and that ‘I’ should be responsible for making the important intellectual judgments (P4, P10, P18).\nSecondly, it can be difficult and even disruptive to put ideas into words.\nAlthough professional philosophy is mainly formally done in language, the process of thinking through ideas can involve many other dimensions of representation and thinking (P2, P3, P4, P5).\nAmong other challenges, philosophers cite the apparent incongruence between ideas and language as a source of significant burden in learning how to effectively use LMs (P8, P21).\nThis may be true for many other areas of critical thinking.\nThirdly, philosophers find that human connection is enjoyable and important.\nBesides giving rise to unexpected philosophical connections and ideas (P6), conversation with another human is deeply enjoyable and fulfilling, on its own merits (P8, P21).\nMoreover, some philosophers feel that serious philosophical inquiry requires some kind of subjectivity or lived experience (P6, P8, P16).\nTherefore, LMs will need to coexist with and enrich, rather than seek to replace, the ecosystem of human and textual resources already available to philosophers and other professional critical thinkers."

            "text": "In his masterwork Jerusalem, Moses Mendelssohn writes that philosophy has too long prioritized a dead form of interaction, one which stifles human interaction and innovation: “We teach and instruct one another only through writings; we learn to know nature and human only from writings. We work and relax, edify and amuse ourselves through scribbling…” (Mendelssohn, 1983  ###reference_b57###, 41).\nIn response, Mendelssohn calls for a turn towards a living script, “arousing the mind and heart, full of meaning, continuously inspiring thought”.\nThe living script is a way of engaging with tools that inspire and support our critical thinking; it is an ideal both for LM researchers, philosophers, and all of us – as thinkers and humans – to aspire towards.\nAs technologies for reading and writing our living script, LMs can offer critical thinkers a more wide and accessible set of ways to support individuals in their development of ideas and to shape disciplinary practices and cultures.\nAs for the rights and responsibilities to think – we should respond, with John: “We claim them all.”"
