    "title": "Hippocrates: An Open-Source Framework for Advancing Large Language Models in Healthcare",
    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises to transform medical diagnostics, research, and patient care. Yet, the progression of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets, codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon, refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem. Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient care but also to democratize the benefits of AI research in healthcare, making them available across the globe.",

            "text": "The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse NLP tasks has revolutionized artificial intelligence (Touvron et al., 2023b  ###reference_b42###; Bai et al., 2023  ###reference_b2###; Jiang et al., 2023  ###reference_b15###; OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b27###; Google, 2023  ###reference_b10###). Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, LLMs encounter challenges in clinical contexts, primarily due to a deficiency in domain-specific knowledge and the intricacies of medical terminology. Bridging this gap, in this work, we introduce Hippocrates (named after the Ancient Greek “Father of Medicine”), a state-of-the-art, fully open-source framework designed to elevate LLMs’ proficiency in medical reasoning. We publicly share our training data, complete training and evaluations codes, along with intermediate model checkpoints. Our framework marks an important step towards democratizing advancements in medical LLMs.\nPrevious attempts to develop advanced medical LLMs yielded promising results by further training them (Labrak et al., 2024  ###reference_b20###), supervised fine-tuning them (Li et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###; Han et al., 2023  ###reference_b12###; Toma et al., 2023  ###reference_b40###), or both (Wu et al., 2023  ###reference_b45###; Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###), via special medical-text corpus and medical instruction datasets. However, the data collection, pre-training, and finetuning stages may include considerable complexity, which makes reproducing, analyzing, and comparing the recent LLMs in that domain challenging. On the other hand, closed models, e.g. GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b27###), Gemini (Google, 2023  ###reference_b10###), Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2023b  ###reference_b37###), trained on closed-domain datasets make their results non-reproducible, not to mention substantial computational costs and further complicate the understanding of which components are crucial to the success of these advanced medical frameworks.\n###figure_1### ###figure_2### ###figure_3### ###figure_4### In this work, we provide full access to our framework, from the data sources to the training configurations and the reproducible evaluation protocols. We conduct a detailed empirical analysis to identify the impact of various design elements on LLM performance, leading to a domain-adapted framework that demonstrates superior performance on multiple medical benchmarks. Based on these insights, we develop a step-by-step guide for the efficient training of medical-LLMs. Our research efforts yield two advanced 7B parameter models, Hippo-    and Hippo-   . As shown in Fig. 1  ###reference_###, our models not only outperform existing 7B and 13B models by a significant margin but also deliver results on par with, and in some cases exceeding, those of 70B models.\nWe argue that the development of a broad, varied collection of open models is crucial for deepening our knowledge of language models and enhancing their applicability across various domains.\n###figure_5### ###figure_6### In addition, we adopt a novel strategy for structuring our instruction tuning (IT) dataset, dividing it into two distinct components: the General Instruction Dataset and the Evaluation Instruction Dataset. The General dataset is designed to enable unbiased assessments by avoiding overlap with downstream task data, marking a departure from previous methodologies. On the other hand, the Evaluation Instruction Dataset, which incorporates training splits from evaluation benchmarks, facilitates direct comparisons with existing models (Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###). Notably, for the first time in the medical domain, our approach incorporates preference learning from medical professionals into the model development process, utilizing RLAIF (Lee et al., 2023b  ###reference_b22###) and GPT4 for annotating preferences.\nFor model evaluation, we employ the well-established EleutherAI framework111https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness  ###reference_n-harness### (Gao et al., 2021  ###reference_b9###), conducting tests across a set of six varied medical downstream tasks. These include MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022  ###reference_b31###), PubmedQA (Jin et al., 2019  ###reference_b17###), MedQA (Jin et al., 2021  ###reference_b16###), and the USMLE-step1, USMLE-step2, and USMLE-step3. Leveraging this framework allows for straightforward replication of any LLM’s results, eliminating the necessity for additional fine-tuning or the repetitive execution of evaluation scripts for each new model."

This pipeline ensures our models are precisely tailored and rigorously tested for the medical domain.\n###figure_7### This dataset aggregates more than 400K samples from nine different datasets, each derived from the instruction corpora of previous studies (Li et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###; Han et al., 2023  ###reference_b12###; Wu et al., 2023  ###reference_b45###; Lee et al., 2023a  ###reference_b21###). By excluding data from the training or test splits of downstream QA benchmarks, we aim to minimize bias and improve the model’s generalization capabilities across different reasoning tasks. A pre-processing protocol was employed to remove superfluous words and web URLs, ensuring the data’s quality and relevance. The detailed statistics of the dataset are presented in Table 2  ###reference_###.\nThis dataset was formed to examine the effects of including instruction samples directly from downstream tasks, a common practice in existing studies (Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###; Han et al., 2023  ###reference_b12###; Wu et al., 2023  ###reference_b45###). Instruction-response pairs were crafted using the training splits of various benchmarks, following the templates established in Meditron (Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b6###). We conducted a series of experiments to assess the distinct influence of each split on each task, both individually and collectively. The details about the Evaluation Instruction Data is given in Table 3  ###reference_###.\nBeyond independently utilizing these datasets for supervised fine-tuning, we also examined the impact of individual datasets as well as the collective effect of combining them on model performance (refer to Appendix G  ###reference_###).\nTo reduce annotation costs, we adopted the RLAIF methodology (Lee et al., 2023b  ###reference_b22###) in the medical domain for the first time. Utilizing detailed prompts based on patient inquiries from the iCliniq-10k dataset, we used GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b27###) to determine the optimal response based on predefined instructions. These instructions were derived from those used in qualitative assessments by medical professionals in Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2022  ###reference_b35###; 2023a  ###reference_b36###), with minor modifications. This annotation approach amounted to a cost of $120. The exact prompt structure for applying RLAIF with GPT4 is given in Appendix J  ###reference_###, Figure 7  ###reference_###.\nTo test the reliability of GPT4’s capacity to replicate medical expert annotations, we subjected 250 samples from our dataset to careful examination by two medical doctors, given them the same instructions that we provided in the prompt to GPT4.\nOur analysis revealed compelling results. When comparing GPT4’s annotations against those of MD-1, GPT4 demonstrated a Kappa Score of 0.376, indicating moderate agreement, and an accuracy of 68.9%. The comparison with MD-2 showed even stronger results, with GPT4 achieving a Kappa Score of 0.672, suggesting substantial agreement, alongside an 83.6% accuracy. Interestingly, the inter-annotator agreement between the two doctors themselves yielded a Kappa Score of 0.416 and an accuracy of 70.8%, situating GPT4’s performance firmly within the range of human expert variability. These findings not only affirm GPT4’s aptitude for medical annotation but also highlight its potential to serve as a cost-effective alternative to human annotators in medical research and application settings. These findings suggest that GPT4 is capable of effectively mimicking medical doctor preferences, potentially eliminating the need for costly doctor annotations.\nConsequently, we compiled a comprehensive medical doctor preference dataset, consisting of 15,258 samples, to further align our LLMs with real-world clinical decision-making processes and enhance their accuracy in interpreting and responding to medical queries.\nTo equip our base LLMs with domain-specific medical expertise, we extend their pre-training on a carefully curated medical text corpus as described in Section 2.1  ###reference_###. This stage employs traditional language modeling, focusing on next-token prediction. During this phase, both models undergo continued pre-training using LoRA, specifically adapting the fully connected layers. The parameters for LoRA are carefully set, with the rank () at 8 and alpha () at 16, to optimize learning. We use the AdamW optimizer and adjust the learning rate using a cosine scheduling, starting from an initial value of 1e-4. The batch size per device was initialized to be 8, with gradient accumulations of 2, culminating in an effective global batch size of 16, and the models are trained for a single epoch. The rationale and empirical support for our choices regarding the dataset, LoRA configurations, and overall optimization strategy are comprehensively analyzed in Appendix G  ###reference_.SSS0.Px1###.\nAfter continued pre-training, models undergo fine-tuning with an Instruction Tuning (IT) dataset to closely mirror medical directives, aligning model outputs with clinical requirements. We have tested with the datasets described in Section 2.2  ###reference_### and found that MedQA-train IT works better than the other options. This fine-tuning phase also employs LoRA to all fully connected layers with both rank () and alpha () set to 32 for balanced efficiency and computational overhead. AdamW optimizer is used with a learning rate of . To prevent model overfitting, loss calculation focuses solely on the responses. The training spanned 3 epochs with a batch size of 8 per-device and gradient accumulation set to 2. We also conducted experiments on direct fine-tuning of the base LLMs to evaluate the impact of continued pre-training (see Section 4.1  ###reference_###) and performed a comprehensive analysis on dataset splits and fine-tuning hyperparameters (see Appendix G  ###reference_.SSS0.Px2###).\nFinally, the instruction-tuned models are further trained with a recent and popular technique called direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023  ###reference_b33###). In DPO, reinforcement learning is bypassed which allows for direct optimization based on preference data. Unlike RLHF, the responses in DPO need not be derived from the LLM being optimized. Central to DPO is the development of a loss function that evaluates the likelihood of a preferred response over a less preferred one, steering the LLM towards this goal. This makes DPO more stable and significantly reduces computational demands.\nThe outcome of all this are our medical LLMs, named Hippo-    and Hippo-   , built upon the pre-trained LLaMA2 7B and Mistral 7B models. These models were refined through a comprehensive process that included continued pre-training and/or instruction tuning using our carefully curated medical datasets. Following this, we also explored the impact of aligning the models with clinical preferences by conducting further training on medical preference data.\n###figure_8### ###figure_9###"

To circumvent these issues, we leveraged the iCliniq-10k dataset (Li et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###), containing 10K authentic patient-doctor dialogues from icliniq.com.

As listed in Table 6  ###reference_###, the base model LLaMA2 7B initially achieves an average accuracy of 34.0 across benchmarks. The CP stage marginally increases accuracy to 34.4, indicating initial benefits from domain-focused continued pre-training.

            "text": "The CoT prompting technique (Wei et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###) enhances an LLM’s ability to tackle complex queries by guiding it to articulate intermediate reasoning steps. This method improves the model’s responses by structuring its problem-solving process. In our study, we applied CoT prompting for in-context learning, adopting a slightly altered instruction utilized in (Pal & Sankarasubbu, 2024b  ###reference_b30###): ”The following is a multiple choice question about medical knowledge. Solve it in a step-by-step fashion, starting by summarizing the available information. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer.”. However, the application of CoT prompting in our experiments with downstream medical tasks did not consistently enhance our models’ performance, as shown in Table 6  ###reference_###."

            "text": "We explore the application of Influence Functions to understand the behavior of LLMs (Grosse et al., 2023  ###reference_b11###) – in our context, particularly those trained with domain-specific datasets like medical text. This technique quantifies the effect of single training instances on the model’s predictions, improving the transparency of the AI models. This is increasingly important as the field of Explainable AI (XAI) grows to make AI systems more interpretable and accountable. However, the complexity of LLMs, which process vast amounts of data, highlights the necessity for efficient methods to perform this analysis. We believe incorporating this tool to our evaluation framework will prove useful for future studies.\nIn the supplementary material (Appendix H  ###reference_###), we present our analysis results, highlighting the most and least influential training examples for a MedQA dataset question and its model response. Notably, the most influential example shares overlapping medical concepts, in contrast to no shared concepts with the least influential training example."

            "text": "In our study, we conducted an uncertainty quantification experiment on Hippo-    to understand its performance on the MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA datasets, as shown in Fig.3  ###reference_###. Our findings reveal that our model consistently assigns higher probabilities to questions it answers correctly across all datasets, suggesting an ability to self-calibrate its certainty. The model’s confidence is notably higher on MedMCQA, possibly reflecting the dataset’s relative simplicity. In contrast, its confidence on PubMedQA is comparatively lower, likely due to the dataset’s complexity. Additionally, the model’s confidence changes with different training stages; CPT leads to more conservative estimates, SFT boosts confidence, and adding DPO leads to variable confidence, with noticeable effects in MedMCQA and MedQA. These outcomes emphasize a complex relationship between training approaches and confidence calibration in the model.\n###figure_32### ###figure_33### ###figure_34### We present additional negative results in Appendix J  ###reference_###, which we anticipate will be beneficial for the community. By sharing these findings, we aim to encourage further investigations."

We also introduce Hippo-    and Hippo-   , two 7B models demonstrating superior performance. Our work makes substantial contributions to the field by combining in-depth empirical research with a structured training methodology, offering invaluable insights and tools for future research not only in healthcare but in any area requiring domain-specific adaptation of LLMs.\n###figure_35### ###figure_36###"
