    "title": "Speech Robust Bench: A Robustness Benchmark For Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models become ever more pervasive, it is important to ensure that they make reliable predictions under corruptions present in the physical and digital world. We propose Speech Robust Bench (SRB), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of ASR models to diverse corruptions. SRB is composed of 69 input perturbations which are intended to simulate various corruptions that ASR models may encounter in the physical and digital world. We use SRB to evaluate the robustness of several state-of-the-art ASR models and observe that model size and certain modeling choices such as discrete representations, and self-training appear to be conducive to robustness. We extend this analysis to measure the robustness of ASR models on data from various demographic subgroups, namely English and Spanish speakers, and males and females, and observed noticeable disparities in the model’s robustness across subgroups. We believe that SRB will facilitate future research towards robust ASR models, by making it easier to conduct comprehensive and comparable robustness evaluations.",

            "text": "Robustness to input perturbations is a highly desirable attribute in Machine Learning (ML) models. When deployed in the real world, ML models are likely to encounter noise and corruptions arising from a myriad of sources, including the environment, sensing apparatus, and even malicious actors. The ability of the models to counteract these sources of noise and continue to make accurate predictions has significant implications for their safety, security, and reliability. As novel ML models continue to be developed and deployed at an ever-increasing rate, it has become all the more important to ensure that their robustness is well understood. To this end, prior works have developed robustness benchmarks that evaluate various aspects of a model’s performance under a variety of input perturbations. These benchmarks have proven to be invaluable to the advancement of research into more robust models because (1) they enable meaningful comparisons across existing and new models, which allows progress to be accurately tracked, and (2) make it easier for researchers to evaluate the robustness of their models, thereby reducing the barrier to entry into robustness research. While robustness benchmarks have been proposed in prior works for vision (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2021a, b; Croce et al., 2020) and natural language processing (Wang et al., 2021a, 2022b) tasks, the development of such benchmarks for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models has received little attention beyond benchmarks based on simple digit sequence recognition (Hirsch & Pearce, 2000). In the absence of standardized benchmarks, prior works have tried to evaluate the robustness of ASR models in various different ways. For example, several works have used a combination of distortions from various datasets to perturb the input audio (Radford et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2022), however, since the choice of dataset varies among studies, their results are not comparable. Other, more recent, works (Likhomanenko et al., 2020; Radford et al., 2023; Hsu et al., 2021b) have evaluated the robustness of models by computing their transcription accuracy on multiple speech datasets that may have perturbations from the real world. Since the type of perturbations present in these datasets is not controlled and is unknown, this evaluation method does not inform about the specific type of perturbations the models may be weak against. Moreover, prior works rarely evaluate their proposed models against adversarial attacks (unless they are proposing defenses), and thus neglect to highlight potential security vulnerabilities of the models. \n\nIn this paper, we propose Speech Robust Bench (SRB), a standardized robustness benchmark for ASR models. Following the design of successful robustness benchmarks for image recognition (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019; Croce et al., 2020), SRB is composed of two parts: (1) a comprehensive bank of perturbations, and (2) a set of robustness metrics. The perturbations bank contains a comprehensive set of perturbations that represent common distortions arising from the environment or equipment, variations in speaker attributes, semantic preserving special effects found in digital media, and adversarial attacks. Meanwhile, the metrics we propose, following the methodology of (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), measure two aspects of robustness: the transcription accuracy of the models, as well as the stability of the predicted transcripts under randomized perturbations. To highlight the need for and the benefits of doing systematic robustness assessment, we evaluate the robustness of several popular ASR models using SRB, and compare their robustness. We observe that while Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) is the most robust on average among the models we tested, it is outperformed by other, smaller, models on several perturbations. Further analyses reveal that larger models tend to be more robust than smaller models, even if the latter are trained on significantly more data. We further extend our analysis by evaluating the models’ robustness for the various population sub-groups, namely, English and non-English (Spanish) speakers, and male and female speakers. We find that significant disparities exist across these sub-groups, thus identifying areas where future work could provide improvements, and demonstrating the utility of SRB in fairness evaluations as well. \n\nTo summarize we make the following contributions: We present SRB, a robustness benchmark for ASR models, which can result in directly comparable robustness evaluations and facilitate progress. We open source our code with clear documentation of existing use cases and support easy extensibility. We release perturbed versions of the ImageNet test set to facilitate out-of-the-box robustness evaluations for the research community. We demonstrate the use of SRB by conducting a fine-grained robustness analysis for several popular models. We extend our analysis by using SRB to uncover disparities in the robustness of ASR"

            "text": "Over the years, several techniques have been proposed for making Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models robust to input perturbations, such as noise and other signal corruptions (Li et al., 2014  ###reference_b29###). We can divide these techniques into two high-level categories: i) model-based and ii) feature-based. i) Model-based techniques modify the models to make them more robust. Examples of such approaches include adapting pre-trained models (Yu et al., 2009  ###reference_b57###; Juang & Rahim, 1996  ###reference_b22###), denoising the audio before processing (Mohammadiha et al., 2013  ###reference_b33###; Wilson et al., 2008  ###reference_b54###), and training ASR models on noisy data (Likhomanenko et al., 2020  ###reference_b30###). Since model based strategies generally require access to noisy data (Li et al., 2014  ###reference_b29###), they are most effective if the sources of noise, and/or the exact environment in which the ASR model will be deployed in are known, and one can gather data to represent them. ii) Feature-based approaches, on the other hand, involve developing handcrafted features that are invariant to noise and corruptions in the signal (Li et al., 2014  ###reference_b29###). Several of these features are inspired by biological audition (Kim & Stern, 2016  ###reference_b23###; Hermansky et al., 1991  ###reference_b17###; Hermansky & Sharma, 1998  ###reference_b16###), while others use signal processing techniques (Li et al., 2014  ###reference_b29###). Generally, these methods are designed to extract the components of the audio signal salient for speech production and perception, while discarding irrelevant components (Stern & Morgan, 2012  ###reference_b44###). Consequently, they do not require precise knowledge of the environment and noise distributions. Recently, however, handcrafted features have fallen out of favor, and have been replaced by features learned via end-to-end training of deep learning models on large amounts of data (Baevski et al., 2020  ###reference_b4###; Hsu et al., 2021a  ###reference_b19###; Likhomanenko et al., 2020  ###reference_b30###; Radford et al., 2023  ###reference_b42###). Proponents of these techniques posit that models trained on larger datasets become more robust. Our evaluations in § 4  ###reference_### reveal that there are several input perturbations against which smaller models trained on less data outperform larger models trained on more data."

            "text": "Adversarial perturbations are perturbations that can change the response of a model when added to their inputs, but are either imperceptible to humans or perceptually and semantically irrelevant enough to be ignored by them (Szegedy et al., 2014  ###reference_b45###; Goodfellow et al., 2014  ###reference_b12###). Adversarially perturbed inputs are known as adversarial attacks. They can be targeted (aiming to change a prediction to a specific incorrect class), or un-targeted (aiming to change a prediction to any incorrect class, Akhtar et al. 2021  ###reference_b1###). The design of adversarial attacks is determined by the level of knowledge the attacker is assumed to have about the target model. Attacks that assume full knowledge of the target model’s architecture and weights (white-box threat model) often use gradient-based optimization techniques (Szegedy et al., 2014  ###reference_b45###; Goodfellow et al., 2014  ###reference_b12###; Madry et al., 2018  ###reference_b32###; Laidlaw et al., 2021  ###reference_b27###; Akhtar et al., 2021  ###reference_b1###).\nAttackers who do not have any knowledge of the target models architecture and only have query access to it (black-box threat model) typically use gradient-free optimization methods (Wang et al., 2022a  ###reference_b50###; Andriushchenko et al., 2020  ###reference_b3###; Wicker et al., 2018  ###reference_b53###; Chen et al., 2017  ###reference_b8###; Zhao et al., 2020  ###reference_b58###; Vo et al., 2022  ###reference_b47###). An intriguing property of adversarial perturbations is that they transfer between models (Papernot et al., 2016  ###reference_b38###), and inputs (Akhtar et al., 2021  ###reference_b1###; Neekhara et al., 2019  ###reference_b35###). Our SRB includes two types of white box adversarial attacks: those that generate perturbations specific to each input (Madry et al., 2018  ###reference_b32###), and those that generate perturbations that cause models to mis-transcribe multiple inputs (Neekhara et al., 2019  ###reference_b35###)."

(2021a  ###reference_b14###) propose benchmarks and metrics for measuring the robustness of image recognition models to non-adversarial perturbations. In the domain of NLP, Wang et al. (2021a  ###reference_b48###) propose a benchmark to evaluate models under various lexical and semantic perturbations, such as typos, distractors, and word replacements. However, in the domain of ASR, there is a lack of similar comprehensive benchmarks that measure the robustness of ASR models on diverse corruptions. The current benchmarks are often specialized to one (or few) types of perturbations such as reverberation (Nakamura et al., 2000  ###reference_b34###; Kinoshita et al., 2013  ###reference_b24###; Jeub et al., 2009  ###reference_b21###), environmental noise (Barker et al., 2018  ###reference_b5###; Piczak, 2015  ###reference_b39###), and accented speech (Lander, 2022  ###reference_b28###; Shi et al., 2021  ###reference_b43###). While there is some initial work in developing more comprehensive benchmarks (Hirsch & Pearce, 2000  ###reference_b18###), it is limited to relatively simple data consisting of spoken sequences of digits, which lack the complexity of long sentences that modern ASR models are expected to transcribe.\nSome recent works (Radford et al., 2023  ###reference_b42###; Likhomanenko et al., 2020  ###reference_b30###) have evaluated the robustness of ASR models by computing transcription accuracy on several speech datasets. We find that this evaluation method is too coarse to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the models; for example, Likhomanenko et al. (2020  ###reference_b30###) present the word error rates for three settings: clean, noisy, and extreme, for each dataset, from which it is difficult to determine the kinds of noise or distortions the model has difficulties with. Furthermore, most robustness evaluations of ASR models do not consider adversarial robustness, and thus neglect to highlight potential security vulnerabilities of the models."

Doing so penalizes errors on “easy” corruptions more than errors on “harder” corruptions. This normalized metric is called Normalized TER (NTER, see § 3.5 ###reference_.SSS0.Px2###).

Our analysis is two-pronged. First, we focus on the primary goal of SRB, which is to measure the robustness of the models to various input perturbations. As a case study, we use SRB to evaluate the prediction accuracy and stability of the English ASR models as different perturbations are introduced. As mentioned in § 3.2 ###reference_###, we use image data from ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009 ###reference_b37###). We extend our analysis by studying the relationship between robustness and various model characteristics, such as the number of parameters and size of the training data. Having considered robustness averaged over the entire population (represented in the dataset), we extend our analysis to the robustness of the models for various population sub-groups, namely object categories, color distributions, daytime scenes, and nighttime scenes. Prior works (Liu et al., 2022 ###reference_b31###; Veliche & Fung, 2023 ###reference_b46###) observe that there is disparity in classification accuracy between subgroups.\n\nOur analysis augments these observations by showing that inter-group disparities in robustness may also exist, and thus demonstrating the utility of SRB in the broader field of trustworthy AI. The diverse image categories are obtained from the validation set of ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015 ###reference_b40###). \n\nWe first consider non-adversarial perturbations. In the following, we measure the robustness of the candidate models under each perturbation and at each severity level to identify potential failure modes. We evaluate the English-only DNNs from Table 1 ###reference_### on the untargeted image-agnostic perturbations and untargeted specific perturbations. Figure 10 ###reference_### in Appendix B ###reference_### shows the accuracy of the DNNs on the two perturbations as well as their average. In terms of average accuracy, Model A emerges as the most robust model followed by Model B. However, looking at the breakdown by perturbation types, we find that while Model B is almost equally susceptible to general and specific perturbations, Model A is much more vulnerable to specific perturbations, but significantly less vulnerable to general perturbations. Therefore, under black- or grey-box scenarios, Model A may be a better choice, while under the white-box threat model Model B may be more robust. Considering the three DNNs based on ResNet: ResNet-50, ResNet-Large, and ResNet-Adv, we note that ResNet-50 achieves the lowest error rate against specific adversarial perturbations, while ResNet-Large achieves the lowest error rate against general adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, ResNet-Adv performs similarly as Model C.\n\nWe note that: (1) the self-training used in Model A may induce robustness to image-agnostic adversarial attacks, (2) the discrete representations of ResNet-50 may induce robustness to specific adversarial attacks, and (3) diversifying training data has little to no effect on adversarial robustness. Finally, Model D is highly vulnerable to specific adversarial attacks.\n\nTo determine if the prevailing practice of training DNNs with more parameters on larger datasets is yielding improvements in robustness, we plot normalized error rate (NER) against the number of model parameters and the size of the training data of all the candidate models. These plots are shown in Figures 3(a) ###reference_sf1### and 3(b) ###reference_sf2###. We note that increasing model size is correlated with improved robustness (lower NER), however, the effect is more inconsistent and weaker for adversarial perturbations. To further isolate the impact of the model size we control the architecture and training data and plot the NER of models from the same family in Figure 3(c) ###reference_sf3###, which have similar architectures and training datasets. We note that larger models are more robust in the ResNet and EfficientNet families, but, surprisingly, not in the VGG family. On the other hand, increasing training data appears to have only a minor influence on robustness.\n\nLarger models tend to be more robust, while smaller models, even if they are trained on large datasets, are less robust.\n###figure_3### ###figure_4### ###figure_5### The overall NER of the under non-adversarial perturbations is presented in Figure 4(a) ###reference_sf1###, and the NER for each perturbation is presented in Figure 11 ###reference_### in Appendix B ###reference_###.

Next, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to better determine under which conditions the models’ performance deteriorates.\n\nWe first consider non-adversarial perturbations. In the following, we measure the robustness of the candidate models under each perturbation and at each severity level to identify potential failure modes. We evaluate the English-only DNNs from Table 1 on the untargeted utterance-agnostic perturbations and untargeted specific perturbations. Figure 10 in Appendix B shows the WER of the DNNs on the two perturbations as well as their average. In terms of average WER w2v2-lg-slf emerges as the most robust model followed by wsp-lg. However, looking at the breakdown by perturbation types, we find that while wsp-lg is almost equally susceptible to general and specific perturbations, w2v2-lg-slf is much more vulnerable to specific perturbations, but significantly less vulnerable to general perturbations. Therefore, under black- or grey-box scenarios, w2v2-lg-slf may be a better choice, while under the white-box threat model wsp-lg may be more robust. Considering the three DNNs that are based on Wav2Vec-2 Large: hubt-lg, w2v2-lg-slf and w2v2-lg-rob, we note that hubt-lg achieves the lowest WER against specific adversarial perturbations, while w2v2-lg-slf achieves the lowest WER against general adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile w2v2-lg-rob performs similarly as w2v2-bs.\n\nWe note that: (1) the self-training used in w2v2-lg-slf may induce robustness to utterance-agnostic adversarial attacks, (2) the discrete representations of hubt-lg may induce robustness to specific adversarial attacks, and (3) diversifying training data has little to no effect on adversarial robustness. Finally, wsp-tn.en is highly vulnerable to specific adversarial attacks.\n\nTo determine if the prevailing practice of training DNNs with more parameters on larger datasets is yielding improvements in robustness, we plot NWER against the number of model parameters and the size of the training data of all the candidate models. These plots are shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b). We note that increasing model size is correlated with improved robustness (lower NWER), however, the effect is more inconsistent and weaker for adversarial perturbations. To further isolate the impact of the model size we control the architecture and training data and plot the NWER of models from the same family in Figure 3(c), which have similar architectures and training datasets. We note that larger models are more robust in the Whisper and Wav2Vec-2.0 families, but, surprisingly, not in the HuBert family. On the other hand, increasing training data appears to have only a minor influence on robustness. Larger models tend to be more robust, while smaller models, even if they are trained on large datasets, are less robust."

            "text": "In the preceding analysis, we considered robustness aggregated over the entire population (i.e. dataset). However, populations are generally not homogeneous, and, thus, the robustness of the model may differ on various population sub-groups. Prior works have commonly analyzed sub-group fairness of image classification models by comparing the overall accuracy for each sub-group on a benchmark dataset (Deng et al., 2009). It is possible that models that are fair on average may not be fair under certain conditions. In the following, we use SRB to uncover and analyze the disparities in the models’ robustness across four sub-groups: different light conditions and object categories. We find that disparities indeed exist, with models generally being more robust under standard lighting conditions than under low-light (Figure 4(b)), and most models being less robust for fine-grained object categories (Figure 12).\n\nThe overall accuracy of the models on ImageNet under non-adversarial perturbations is presented in Figure 4(a), and the accuracy for each perturbation is presented in Figure 11 in Appendix B. We observe that resnet50 is the most robust model, followed by vgg16 and alexnet. It is interesting that despite having 33% more parameters and being trained on 10 more data, vgg16 is outperformed by resnet50, thus indicating that simply scaling the model and training data is not sufficient to achieve robustness, particularly in varied lighting conditions. Extending this analysis further, we measure the degradation in accuracy of vgg16 on each perturbation when classifying different lighting scenarios, and plot the results in Figure 4(b). We observe that while the degradation is greater under low-light conditions, vgg16 struggles particularly with noise perturbations.\n\nvgg16 is not the most robust model under low-light conditions and struggles on simple perturbations like noise.\nTo measure the disparity in prediction accuracy across object categories, we compute the log of the ratio of the accuracies of the image classification model on fine vs. coarse categories. We call this measure the Log Accuracy Ratio (LAR) and formally it can be written as\nwhere the fine and coarse represent the subsets of images by category granularity. A positive value of LAR indicates that the model is biased against fine categories and a negative value indicates that the model is biased against coarse categories.\n\nThe average LAR values for standard and non-standard lighting conditions are shown in Figure 12 and a breakdown by perturbations is shown in Figure 6. We note that, on average, the models are biased against fine categories, and the bias is exacerbated under non-standard lighting. From Figure 5(a) we observe that on well-lit data the image classification models are generally weakly biased against fine categories, with alexnet being the most biased and resnet50 the least. vgg16 is an exception in that it is slightly biased against coarse categories. The bias of the models diminishes significantly under Gaussian noise, but, interestingly it is exacerbated (against fine categories) under blurring and color jitter. Perturbations that distort the images, such as rotations, translations, and cropping have somewhat expected results – perturbations that crop or mask images tend to increase the error rate for fine categories, and vice-versa. Interestingly, we observe that category-agnostic adversarial attacks biased 4/7 models against fine categories, with vgg16 exhibiting the most significant increase in bias.\n\nThe bias against fine categories is more pronounced under non-standard lighting conditions. Unlike well-lit conditions, the bias does not diminish under noise indicating that the models have considerably less robustness against noise for fine categories. The trends for the other categories remain the same as the ones observed under standard conditions, except the increase in bias due to the addition of noise is much greater.\n\nTo summarize, using our benchmark to conduct a fairness analysis reveals that (1) certain perturbations, like noise and adversarial attacks disproportionately degrade the performance of models for fine categories, and (2) the disparity across categories is greater under non-standard conditions and input perturbations tend to further exacerbate this disparity."

            "text": "In this paper we have proposed, SRB, a comprehensive benchmark designed to standardize the robustness evaluations of ASR models. To the best of our knowledge, SRB is the first ASR robustness benchmark that contains long-form speech, and expands the set of distortions to include special effects, speaker attribute modification, and adversarial attacks. We present case studies to demonstrate the utility of SRB in evaluating the robustness of ASR models, as well as its potential to facilitate evaluations of other aspects of trustworthy AI, particularly fairness. Our analysis reveals that while the latest large models, trained on vast quantities of data, are more robust than their counterparts on average, under certain types of perturbations they are outperformed by smaller models trained on lesser data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that model size generally has a greater impact on robustness than the size of the training dataset, which runs somewhat counter to the prevailing wisdom espoused by recent works (Radford et al., 2023  ###reference_b42###; Likhomanenko et al., 2020  ###reference_b30###). We also use SRB to measure the disparities in the robustness of ASR models on data generated by different population subgroups, namely speakers’ language and gender. We find that multi-lingual models are generally more robust for English speech than non-English (Spanish) speech. We also find that under certain perturbations models may be more robust for one gender than the other. We believe that SRB will enable rigorous robustness evaluations of ASR models in a highly standardized manner that will allow comparisons between existing and new approaches and thus facilitate progress tracking. Furthermore, we also release transformed test sets in English and Spanish to facilitate robustness evaluations for researchers and model developers. We believe that this will make robustness evaluations more prevalent and encourage model developers to consider robustness as a key metric to improve."
