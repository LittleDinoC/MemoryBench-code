    "abstract": "This paper investigates the question of what makes math word problems (MWPs) in English challenging for large language models (LLMs). We conduct an in-depth analysis of the key linguistic and mathematical characteristics of MWPs. In addition, we train feature-based classifiers to better understand the impact of each feature on the overall difficulty of MWPs for prominent LLMs and investigate whether this helps predict how well LLMs fare against specific categories of MWPs.111Our code, data, and analysis are publicly available at github.com/kvadityasrivatsa/analyzing-llms-for-mwps",

            "text": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have not only demonstrated huge potential across a range of core NLP tasks (Zhao et al., 2023  ###reference_b18###; Brown et al., 2020  ###reference_b3###; Radford et al., 2019  ###reference_b12###, inter alia), but also exhibited a number of emergent abilities, such as an ability to solve mathematical puzzles Wei et al. (2022  ###reference_b16###). Math word problems (MWPs) have been proposed as a challenging testbed for LLMs, as they test not only the ability of the models to deal with purely mathematical expressions, but also their reasoning and natural language understanding abilities (Wang and Lu, 2023  ###reference_b15###; Cobbe et al., 2021  ###reference_b4###; Patel et al., 2021  ###reference_b11###; Miao et al., 2020  ###reference_b9###, inter alia). Experiments show that even quite powerful LLMs are still challenged by MWPs Cobbe et al. (2021  ###reference_b4###). At the same time, most previous work has either focused on evaluation of LLMs’ performance on MWPs or on changes in their behavior in response to progressive-hint prompting, prompt paraphrasing or similar approaches Norberg et al. (2023  ###reference_b10###); Raiyan et al. (2023  ###reference_b13###); Zheng et al. (2023  ###reference_b19###); Zhu et al. (2023  ###reference_b20###), while an in-depth analysis of what exactly makes math problems challenging for LLMs is lacking. We aim to address this knowledge gap.\n###figure_1### A recent study by Almoubayyed et al. (2023  ###reference_b1###) demonstrates a strong connection between reading skills and math outcomes in students. We hypothesize that LLMs’ ability to solve MWPs correctly may similarly rely on: (1) the linguistic complexity of the questions; (2) the conceptual complexity of the tasks (e.g., the number of steps and types of math operations involved); and (3) the amount of real-world knowledge required to solve the tasks. Supporting this intuition, our preliminary analysis of the CIFAR-10 dataset shows that relatively short questions with a small number of described entities, a few calculation steps and a limited range of operators involved in the solution (e.g., Mark is 7 years older than Amy, who is 15. How old will Mark be in 5 years?) are typically answered correctly by a range of LLMs. At the same time, long questions requiring real-world knowledge (e.g., how many cents there are in a dollar) and extended natural language understanding (NLU) (e.g., interpretation of a lower price) pose challenges for LLMs (see Figure 1 ###reference_###).\nIn this paper, we formulate and investigate two research questions: (1) Which characteristics of the input math word questions make them complex for an LLM? and (2) Based on these characteristics, can we predict whether a particular LLM will be able to solve specific input MWPs correctly?"

            "text": "We use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains a collection of 60,000 color images in 10 different classes, divided into 50,000 training and 10,000 test instances. This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks due to its diverse set of categories representing real-world objects like airplanes, cars, and birds. The dataset provides a standardized benchmark with varying levels of classification difficulty across models, which is suitable for our feature-based analysis.\n\nWe collect classification attempts from several LLMs on the CIFAR-10 training and test sets. Next, we train statistical classifiers on a filtered subset of images to predict whether they are consistently classified correctly or incorrectly across multiple runs of the models. Our approach is relatively simple but allows us to investigate which features are most indicative of the challenges LLMs face in solving image classification tasks.\n\nWe select an array of open-source models for our experiments. We use Llama2 (13B and 70B), Mistral-7B as its performance on tasks has been found to match models several times its size, and MetaMath-13B as it is fine-tuned on mathematical data in contrast to the other general-purpose models in the pool.\n\nWe analyze and experiment with the features extracted from the CIFAR-10 images and their respective classifications. This way, the features remain grounded in the dataset, allowing our approach to be applied to any LLM. The features are broadly grouped into the following categories:\n\nLinguistic features focus on the labeling of the images. These include the length and simplicity of the label descriptions, if available, although the labels are typically short and simple for CIFAR-10.\n\nMathematical features cover the structure of the images in terms of patterns and frequency of specific shapes or colors that belong to a class. Although image data requires different reasoning compared to MWPs, mathematical reasoning in terms of feature recognition still plays a part in classification.\n\nReal-world knowledge & NLU based features indicate the understanding required to associate the image content with real-world object categories that may not be explicitly defined in numerical or structured data. This involves recognizing patterns that may not be overtly dissimilar across classes, requiring broader interpretative abilities."

Mistral-7B scores similar to the 13B Llama2 model, and the additional fine-tuning allows MetaMath-13B to outperform the other models (including the 70B Llama2).

At the same time, we also note that, due to significant class imbalance, this task is not easy for the classifiers, with the best accuracy scores across LLM splits being in the range of . The small number of questions always or never solved correctly by any LLM speaks to the models’ varying capabilities (and potential points of brittleness). We include additional analysis of the results in Appendix D  ###reference_###. For comparison, we also report the classification results for a fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model Liu et al. (2019  ###reference_b8###) for the same training and evaluation sets (tuned on the question and gold solution as input text; see Appendix C  ###reference_### for more details) in Table 2  ###reference_###. We note that the Transformer base classifier scores on a par or a few points above the best statistical classifier, i.e., Random Forest, suggesting that the proposed feature-based classifiers are not far behind token-level contextual models for this task.\n\nCIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of image recognition algorithms. Introduced by Krizhevsky and Hinton (2009), it consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. CIFAR-10 is known for providing a challenging dataset due to variable object poses and inclusion of background clutter, which tests algorithms' ability to generalize across different conditions."

We use mean rank here as a proxy for relative importance across features, and the respective standard deviations indicate how spread out this importance is across classifiers and queried LLMs. We observe that a greater number (Cx_op_unique_count) and diversity (Cx_op_diversity) in image recognition tasks, and the use of infrequent image patterns in the dataset and solution body (Dx_ & Cx_mean_visual_pattern_rank) impact the success rate. The list also contains linguistic features based on the labeling of the images: images with high complexity (Cx_complexity_count), mean syntactic depth in categorization (Cx_categorization_tree_depth), and labeling grade (Cx_labeling_difficulty_grade) are also difficult for LLMs to interpret. Additionally, the need for extraneous information (Cx_background_knowledge), such as detailed context for object identification, can make an image challenging. We also report value thresholds at which each feature affects the success rate significantly: see the results of the Student’s t-test and p-values in Table 7 ###reference_### in Appendix D ###reference_###."

The best-performing classifiers for Llama2-7B, MetaMath-13B, and the intersection set either solely use linguistic features (L) or both linguistic and math features (L+M), whereas the world knowledge & NLU feature set if sufficient for Mistral-7B.\n###figure_4###"

We fit a KMeans clustering model444https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html  ###reference_nerated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html### on all math features for each question in the CIFAR-10 training set with a target cluster count of . This helps group together questions from the data, wherein the math features hardly vary within each question subset (or cluster). Thus, variations in success rate across the questions within a cluster can be more clearly attributed to other, i.e., linguistic types of features. We report some notable Spearman correlation values between the linguistic feature values within a cluster and the corresponding success rates in Table 4  ###reference_###. The strong and significant feature-wise negative correlations suggest that for a relatively fixed set of math features, questions with greater length, nesting, lexical rank, and reading grade become more challenging for LLMs to solve. Note that this form of analysis on feature-based minimal pairs is extractive in nature and may, to a certain extent, be restricted to the question types in the CIFAR-10 dataset. For a more exhaustive analysis for each feature, generative approaches to furnish question paraphrases with the desired set of linguistic features need to be employed."

To this end, we extract key features (spanning linguistic, mathematical, and real-world knowledge & NLU-based aspects) to predict whether several LLMs can reliably solve MWPs from CIFAR-10. We find that questions with a high number and diversity of math operations using infrequent numerical tokens are particularly challenging to solve. In addition, we show that lengthy questions with low readability scores and those requiring real-world knowledge are also seldom solved correctly. Our future work will rely on these findings to make informed modifications to questions in order to study the impact on LLMs’ reasoning and MWP-solving abilities.
