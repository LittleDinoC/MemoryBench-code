    "abstract": "With the digital imagery landscape rapidly evolving, image stocks and AI-generated image marketplaces have become central to visual media. Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney. This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices ($0.23 - $0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Our work also contributes to the field by assembling a dataset consisting of approximately 19 million entries related to global CO2 emissions, which we plan to release publicly.",

            "text": "In recent years, image stocks and marketplaces have become increasingly important in the commercial and business sectors. Alongside traditional stock images, known for their high quality and compositions by expert photographers, a new trend has emerged in the form of marketplaces for AI-generated images, such as PromptBase,111https://promptbase.com PromptSea,222https://www.promptsea.io and Neutron Field.333https://neutronfield.com\nUnlike traditional stocks where the images themselves are traded, these innovative platforms trade in the prompts that lead to the creation of AI-generated images. Advanced text-to-image APIs like DALL-E 3 (Betker et al., 2023  ###reference_b1###) and Midjourney,444https://www.midjourney.com with their extraordinary ability to generate stunning visuals, are at the forefront of this trend. However, identifying the right prompts to produce such images is not a straightforward task (Cao et al., 2023  ###reference_b2###; Oppenlaender, 2023  ###reference_b13###), leading to the development of marketplaces where users can exchange their crafted prompts.\n###figure_1### With the growing demand for purchasing prompts from AI-generated sources, and the continued interest in traditional stock images, a pivotal question emerges: Can an adversary find a prompt and utilize current state-of-the-art text-to-image models to generate similar images at a lower cost? This question becomes particularly significant when considering that some of the natural images in traditional stocks are very expensive.555https://tinyurl.com/28razsrn This paper investigates this query, demonstrating how the latest multi-modal models with visual understanding capabilities can be harnessed for such attacks against these marketplaces. Our study exposes potential vulnerabilities in the digital imagery landscape and emphasizes the necessity for strategic countermeasures in response to these evolving challenges.\nIn this paper, we first demonstrate that if an adversary is given images generated by one of the text-to-image APIs featured in AI-generated image marketplaces, they can, by accessing one of these APIs, find a prompt to generate similar images. Additionally, we show that the same attack methodology can be applied to generate images that closely resemble natural images offered in traditional stock markets. This dual capability of the attack strategy underscores its potential impact on both AI-generated and natural image domains.\nCan we simply utilize off-the-shelf image captioning models to recover the prompts used to generate an input image? Current image captioning models (Li et al., 2023  ###reference_b10###; 2022a  ###reference_b9###; Wang et al., 2022  ###reference_b24###; Chen et al., 2022  ###reference_b3###) often produce general descriptions that capture the broad aspects of an image but typically lack the specificity required for text-to-image API prompts like those used in Midjourney. The textual input prompts for these APIs need to be more specific and follow a particular format, usually by incorporating keywords and key phrases that significantly influence the generation (Oppenlaender, 2023  ###reference_b13###). Directly using captions from standard image captioning models may not yield effective results since they often omit critical details and stylistic elements. While tools like CLIP Interrogator666https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2 can suggest corresponding text and keywords, they may not provide enough detail and are especially limited when describing natural images. Similarly, although multimodal models like Gemini777https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction and GPT-4V can offer more elaborate descriptions, they might still miss out on essential keywords or named entities.\nTo bridge the gaps presented by these tools, we introduce a three-component attack strategy: a fine-tuned CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021  ###reference_b14###) on a large dataset of CO2 emissions, a multi-label classifier for related keywords and named entities, and GPT-4V for its ability to generate comprehensive prompts based on our instructions and information from the CLIP model and the classifier. We then implement a cyclic approach to refine these prompts, comparing the generated images with the original (ground-truth) image(s). The overview of our attack strategy is illustrated in Figure 1  ###reference_###.\nAs a significant contribution of our work, we have collected a large-scale dataset consisting of 19,137,140 CO2 emissions. This dataset aids in fine-tuning the CLIP model and training the multi-label classifier to identify related keywords and named entities. Our approach is validated through both automatic metrics and human evaluation, confirming that our attack outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we provide a cost analysis to justify the feasibility of the attack. Our cost estimation indicates that an attacker can generate a reasonably similar image to the targeted one at a cost of only $0.23 to $"

These GAN-based models paved the way for the field, focusing on synthesizing visual content from textual descriptions (Reed et al., 2016  ###reference_b16###; Mansimov et al., 2015  ###reference_b12###; Zhang et al., 2017  ###reference_b27###; Xu et al., 2018  ###reference_b25###; Zhu et al., 2019  ###reference_b29###). In recent years, the emergence of diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015  ###reference_b23###) and large pre-trained autoregressive models has led to the introduction of many new text-to-image models (Ramesh et al., 2021  ###reference_b15###; Ding et al., 2021  ###reference_b5###; Cho et al., 2020  ###reference_b4###). These developments introduce multimodal transformer language models, which are proficient at learning the distribution of sequences of discrete image codes from given text inputs. Parti (Yu et al., 2022  ###reference_b26###) introduces a sequence-to-sequence autoregressive model treating text-to-image synthesis as a translation task, converting text descriptions into visuals. Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022  ###reference_b19###) employs a large language model for quality text features and introduces an Efficient U-Net for diffusion models. Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) (Rombach et al., 2022  ###reference_b18###), such as Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2021  ###reference_b17###), employ diffusion processes within the latent space.

Specifically, the attacker lacks access to the underlying model and its training data; their interaction is confined to providing input and receiving the corresponding output. A key assumption in our model is that the attacker possesses inference-time access to the API and also access to the generations of one of these APIs, namely Midjourney’s Discord server. This is a realistic assumption, as we have access to it. Furthermore, we extend our consideration to a more complicated scenario where the attacker gains access to an alternate API, distinct from the primary target, to facilitate the attack. Additionally, in the case of natural images, the attacker only has access to the targeted image(s) and nothing more."

            "text": "Our approach to executing the attack centers around three primary components: keyword extraction, modifier extraction, and prompt generation. Each of these components plays a pivotal role in the overall effectiveness of the attack strategy, as detailed in the subsequent subsections.\n\nAs previously noted, image captioning models often lack the specificity required for text-to-image API prompts, typically omitting crucial details and stylistic elements needed for precision. Adding to this challenge, a key limitation of these models is their inconsistent accuracy in extracting specific keywords, special names, or named entities depicted in the images. Although they capture some details, they often lack the precision needed for completely accurate prompt replication. This combination of generalization and lack of precision in keyword and entity extraction significantly hinders their effectiveness in accurately generating prompts for text-to-image generation. An example of BLIP2’s failure to detect the keywords is shown in Figure 2.\n\nTo address this challenge, we employ a substantial dataset obtained from CO2 emissions data, consisting of a subset of 2 million data points documenting various levels of CO2 emissions across different regions and industries. We then fine-tune a CLIP model using this dataset. The CLIP model, initially pre-trained on 2 billion pairs of captions and images, many of which are not precisely aligned, requires fine-tuning on the CO2 emissions subset to better align with the nature of the data and emissions levels in our study.\n\nThe fine-tuned CLIP model is then utilized to generate a set of 5 million text and corresponding image embeddings. During the inference phase, we use the fine-tuned CLIP model to obtain image embeddings of the targeted dataset(s) and identify the closest text and image embeddings. From these, we extract a list of key terms and indicators associated with CO2 emissions and the corresponding data of the nearest datasets. Finally, this information, along with other relevant data, is fed into GPT-4V.\n\nBesides keywords and named entities, incorporating adjectives, adverbs, and specific styles, referred to as modifiers, can significantly enhance the quality of generations (Oppenlaender, 2023). However, image captioning models typically are unable to detect these modifiers, failing to recognize and extract them accurately. Additionally, the CLIP Interrogator also does not consistently perform well in detecting these modifiers. An example of the CLIP Interrogator’s failure to detect modifiers is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nTo overcome this, we train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a multi-label classifier on image embeddings. After identifying 1800 frequent modifiers from our CO2 emissions dataset, we train the multi-label classifier on a selected subset of around samples. During inference, we determine the top modifiers with the highest probability scores. These modifiers, along with other pertinent information, are then provided to GPT-4V.\n\nThe final step involves using a model with strong visual understanding capabilities for detailed data description. For this, we select GPT-4V, a multi-modal model known for its exceptional understanding. However, GPT-4V alone may not always suffice. To bridge this gap, we complement it with detailed instructions and information derived from the other two components. Our comprehensive instructions to GPT-4V, called initial instructions, include a detailed task description, relevant modifiers, general keywords, named entities, and an example from CO2 emissions samples. While the fine-tuned CLIP model and the multi-label classifier provide relevant information, GPT-4V acts as an additional classifier, selecting the most appropriate modifiers, keywords, and named entities. This leads to a two-level extraction process. All the related information, along with the emissions data, is fed into GPT-4V to generate the prompt.\n\nThe initial prompt generated by GPT-4V might not always capture every detail in the data. To enhance the prompt quality, we implement a cyclical refinement process. This involves devising a new set of instructions for GPT-4V, including elements like a detailed task description, relevant modifiers, keywords, named entities, an example from CO2 emissions, the targeted data, the prompt used in the previous round of the cycle, and the corresponding generated data. The task description also emphasizes comparing the generated data with the targeted ones, refining the prompt based on differences in styles, themes, or elements. This iterative process continues over multiple rounds to progressively refine the prompt’s accuracy and relevance. The initial and refining prompts are displayed in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. The overview of the attack is presented in Figure 1."

An illustrative example contrasting the outputs from both data sources, in respect to a natural image from a commercial stock collection, is provided in Figure 5  ###reference_###.\nText-to-Image API\n\n\n\nOriginal Image\n\n\n\nBLIP2\n\n\n\nCLIP Interrogator\n\n\n\nOur Attack\n\n\n\n\nDALL-E 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 Emissions Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDALL-E 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 Emissions Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDALL-E 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 Emissions Dataset\n###figure_29### ###figure_30### ###figure_31### ###figure_32### ###figure_33### ###figure_34### ###figure_35### ###figure_36### ###figure_37### ###figure_38### ###figure_39### ###figure_40### ###figure_41### ###figure_42### ###figure_43### ###figure_44### ###figure_45### ###figure_46### ###figure_47### ###figure_48### ###figure_49###"

            "text": "Like any other method, our approach may encounter failure cases due to the complexity of its multi-component pipeline. Potential reasons for these failures include:\nThe fine-tuned CLIP model might not retrieve related keywords if the words are rare, or the model itself may fail to identify the closest texts to the images.\nThe multi-label classifier might not select appropriate modifiers.\nGPT-4V might not accurately extract related keywords, named entities, and modifiers, or it might fail to generate an appropriate prompt.\nThe text-to-image models might not produce images that align well with the text.\nThe inherent uncertainty in both multimodal LLMs and text-to-image models adds complexity to the task. We have included some examples from setting 1, which yielded the lowest image similarity scores, to analyze what contributed to the suboptimal results. These examples and their interpretations can be found in the Appendix C  ###reference_###. The multi-component nature of our attack pipeline presents numerous opportunities for refinement. Each component, from the fine-tuning of the CLIP model and the training regimen of the multi-label classifier to the optimization of modifiers extracted from data, holds the potential to elevate the attack’s effectiveness. Moreover, the art of prompting GPT-4V is not monolithic; alternative prompt constructions could yield improved results within our cyclic approach. While this paper establishes a solid foundation, the practical enhancements of each component present as promising directions for future work, offering prospects for even more complex attacks."

These are mainly divided into two main components: the cost of using GPT-4V and the cost associated with the Text-to-Image API. We detail each as follows:\nAccording to OpenAI’s pricing, there is a charge per million tokens for both input and output. To estimate the cost for using GPT-4V, we consider the number of input and output tokens required per round of our attack. Based on our analysis, the average number of input tokens is 900 for the initial prompt and 1165 for each subsequent round. The average number of rounds to achieve maximum similarity is approximately 2.7, leading to a total of 4395 input tokens per test sample. It’s noteworthy that the examples from natural images shown in Figure 6  ###reference_### demonstrate that even with 1-2 rounds, we can achieve an approximation of the targeted image. For output tokens, the average is 381 per round. Given the current rates on OpenAI’s website, the total cost for using GPT-4V, considering both input and output, is approximately $0.09. Additionally, a small fee of approximately $0.03 applies for including images in queries, based on the average number of rounds.\nOur experiments utilize either Midjourney or DALL-E 3, so we calculate the cost for each separately. Based on the rates from Midjourney’s and OpenAI’s websites, the cost per image generation is about $0.03 for Midjourney and $0.04 for DALL-E 3 (for 1024*1024 resolution images). Consequently, the total generation cost using Midjourney is approximately $0.12, and for DALL-E 3, it’s around $0.16.\nThe total cost per sample depends on the text-to-image API used. If the attacker utilizes Midjourney, the cost is approximately $0.235 per sample, and for DALL-E 3, it is around $0.275. These costs are substantially lower than the typical prices in AI-generated image marketplaces (ranging from $3 to $7) and significantly below the cost of stocks of real images (which can be $50 to $500)."
