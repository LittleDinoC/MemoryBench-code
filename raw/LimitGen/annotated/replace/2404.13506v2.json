This has led to a growing interest in PEFT methods that can reduce the computational cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.  \nPEFT methods aim to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency by selectively updating a subset of model parameters, leveraging knowledge distillation, or exploiting structural redundancy. These methods have the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost and memory usage, making deep learning more accessible and scalable for a wider range of applications and devices. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in PEFT methods, discussing their underlying principles, applications, and trade-offs. We explore state-of-the-art techniques, compare their performance, and highlight the challenges and future research directions in this emerging field. By shedding light on the efficiency aspects of fine-tuning, our paper aspires to contribute to democratizing deep learning and enabling its widespread adoption across applications."

            "text": "Modern pre-trained models (such as BERT Devlin et al. (2018  ###reference_b11###), GPT Radford et al. (2019  ###reference_b36###), T5 Raffel et al. (2020  ###reference_b39###), etc.) consist of billions, if not trillions (especially in case of mixture-of-experts architectures), of parameters. Traditional fine-tuning methods involve adjusting all model parameters to fit the new task or dataset, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. This approach is often referred to as ”full fine-tuning” Lv et al. (2023  ###reference_b31###). Full fine-tuning requires a large amount of data and computational resources to converge Mohammadi and Chapon (2020  ###reference_b32###), which can be a limitation for tasks with limited data availability or computational budgets. Additionally, fine-tuning all parameters often lead to over-fitting, especially when the new task has limited data.\nAnother limitation of traditional fine-tuning methods is that they do not leverage the knowledge gained during pre-training Han et al. (2024  ###reference_b17###). Pre-trained models are typically trained on large datasets and have learned general features that are useful across multiple tasks. Full fine-tuning discards this knowledge and starts from scratch (e.g., Korbak et al. (2022  ###reference_b24###)), which can lead to sub-optimal performance.\nFinally, traditional fine-tuning methods can result in catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets the knowledge learned during pre-training Chen et al. (2020  ###reference_b9###). This can lead to poor performance on both the new task and the original task, making it difficult to achieve good performance across multiple tasks. These limitations have led researchers to explore PEFT methods that can address these issues. PEFT allows to only fine-tune a small number of model parameters while freezing most of the parameters of the pre-trained LLM. PEFT has the following advantages: (i) reduced computational costs (requires fewer GPUs and GPU time); (ii) faster training times (finishes training faster); (iii) lower hardware requirements (works with cheaper GPUs with less VRAM); (iv) better modeling performance (reduces over-fitting); and (v) less storage (majority of weights can be shared across different tasks)."

(2024  ###reference_b50###). The paper presents a specific variant of ReFT, dubbed Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), which modifies the model’s internal representations and exhibits far greater parameter efficiency, with improvements by factors of 10 to 50 compared to contemporary PEFT methods. The foundational mechanism of the LoReFT framework, is defined by the Distributed Interchange Intervention (DII) formula . Wu et al. (2024  ###reference_b50###) employ the projection matrix R to refine the hidden states b, steering them toward a target state s. This method is crafted to subtly yet efficiently influence the model’s output, guiding it towards desired behaviors or responses. Extensive evaluations conducted by the authors on various reasoning tasks and benchmarks such as Alpaca-Eval v1.0 and GLUE indicated that LoReFT not only achieves better efficiency but also superior performance relative to leading PEFT approaches over different datasets in their respective categories. LoReFT achieved state-of-the-art performance for commonsense reasoning, surpassing other methods such as Prefix Tuning Bisk et al. (2019 ###reference_b5###), Adapter-based methods, and LoRA, particularly on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B models. LoReFT showed an accuracy improvement, averaging an 80.2% and 83.3% across different datasets BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaS., WinoG., ARC-e, ARC-c, OBQA, for the Llama 7B and 13B models respectively. See specific results from the paper in Table 1. \n\nThe MNIST dataset is widely used for image processing systems, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. The dataset is composed of handwritten digits and provides a straightforward task for evaluating algorithms. The performance of the LoReFT in arithmetic reasoning Hu et al. (2023 ###reference_b20###) tasks is found to be inferior to that of LoRA and adapters, though it surpasses prefix-tuning. The analysis indicates that LoReFT may encounter more challenges in chain-of-thought reasoning as opposed to single-step commonsense reasoning tasks. This difficulty is attributed to the extended length of generations, which diminishes the efficacy of the intervention, and the inherent complexity of the task. Additionally, the paper revealed that LoReFT demonstrates improved performance with the 13B model compared to the 7B model, suggesting scalability of LoReFT with increased model size. See specific results from the paper in Table 2."

This area looks into finding videos based on text descriptions and creating captions for videos, which is key for making sense of what's happening in a video just by looking at the words linked to it. Fang et al. introduce the Alignment and Generation Adapter (AGAdapter) for enhancing video-text understanding Fang et al. (2023  ###reference_b14###). This integrates a knowledge-sharing alignment adapter with a large language model for video-text retrieval and video captioning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MSR-VTT and ActivityNet benchmarks. Their research introduces a novel approach to video-text understanding by integrating the pre-trained CLIP model (CLIP-bigG/14) for encoding and the LLaMA-7B model for language processing, alongside KaAdapter and Pg Adapter for efficient adaptation. These components work together within a robust tech stack that optimizes video and text alignment across various datasets, including MSR-VTT and ActivityNet, tailored with video and caption lengths set to dataset-specific requirements. Numerical results from an ablation study on the MSR-VTT dataset reveal the AGAdapter’s efficacy, particularly when augmented with LIcap, showcasing remarkable enhancements in video-text retrieval and video captioning metrics compared to the CLIP-finetuned baseline. These outcomes underscore the method's success in delivering significant performance uplifts within minimal training times (0.12 to 0.5 hours), affirming its potential in advancing video-text comprehension tasks with high efficiency and effectiveness.\nSimilarly, the KAdaptation method, achieves a trade-off between accuracy and parameter efficiency in the vision transformer (ViT-B-224/32) through CLIP pretraining He et al. (2023  ###reference_b18###). Evaluated across 20 datasets from the ELEVATER benchmark, this approach notably excels by updating merely 0.09 percent of the model’s parameters, underscoring its efficiency. This result emphasizes the method's capability to maintain high accuracy while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, showcasing its potential for effective and efficient model adaptation."

The study demonstrates PEFT’s superiority over traditional fine-tuning in certain conditions, particularly when data is scarce or model size is large. It underscores the effectiveness of PEFT in reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance, making it a valuable approach for the medical domain. Liu et al. (2023  ###reference_b26###) explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for cell type annotation in scRNA-seq data using scBERT Choromanski et al. (2022  ###reference_b10###).

(2019  ###reference_b19###), BitFit, and LoRA, despite reducing tunable parameters BitFit uses only 0.22 percent of the model’s parameters, maintain performance close to full fine-tuning, with LoRA and a combination of BitFit and LoRA among the most effective strategies. As per the Experiment conducted FT [vanilla fine-tuning] uses 100 percent of the model’s parameters, whereas parameter-efficient methods use significantly less: AP[adapter] uses 1.18 percent, FL[freezing layers tuning] uses 16.66 percent, BF[BitFit] uses 0.22 percent, and LR[LoRA] uses 0.81 percent. Biomedical question answering was shown to significantly improve accuracy with only 0.152 percent of baseline parameters fine-tuned Wang et al. (2023  ###reference_b48###). The strategy adopted includes contrastive learning and self-consistency voting, tested on PubMedQA and BioASQ datasets. Remarkably, it achieves comparable performance to GPT-4, outperforming domain-specific models without external knowledge.

Our review found that leveraging PEFT across diverse applications presents several key challenges that require careful consideration, as practitioners consider applying PEFT for their applications:\nA) Balancing Efficiency and Performance: A core challenge lies in striking a delicate balance between reducing trainable parameters and maintaining robust performance Naveed et al. (2024 ###reference_b34###). Fine-tuning too few parameters might hinder the model’s ability to adapt effectively to the target task, while excessively fine-tuning can negate the computational benefits of PEFTDutt et al. (2023 ###reference_b12###).\nB) Data Scarcity and Generalizability: The success of PEFT can be contingent on the quality and quantity of data available for fine-tuning. In domains with limited or noisy data, PEFT may struggle to achieve the same level of accuracy attainable with full fine-tuning on a larger dataset Dutt et al. (2024 ###reference_b13###). Careful selection of data augmentation techniques and transfer learning strategiesAnjali et al. (2022 ###reference_b2###) can be crucial to mitigate this challenge.\nC) Over-fitting and Generalization Trade-off: There is an inherent risk of over-fitting the model to the training data Chavan et al. (2024 ###reference_b7###), particularly when using a restricted set of parameters for fine-tuning. This can lead to a scenario where the model performs well on the training data but exhibits poor performance on unseen examples. To address this, employing appropriate regularization techniques and meticulous hyperparameter tuning becomes essential to promote better generalization to new data Kirk et al. (2024 ###reference_b23###).\nD) Capacity Constraints of Incremental Modules: Certain PEFT methods introduce additional modules with a reduced number of parameters on top of the pre-trained model. The challenge here lies in ensuring that these smaller modules possess sufficient capacity to learn the intricacies of the specific task effectively, especially when there are strict constraints on the allowable number of parameters. Ongoing research is focused on developing methods to enhance the capacity of these modules without compromising parameter efficiency."

Our analysis reveals that Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes a minimal number of parameters, thus enabling the recalibration of training weights on a single GPU. Conversely, Differentiable Rank Adaptation (DoRA) demonstrates superior performance, outperforming LoRA.\nWe also propose several potential directions for future research to further advance the PEFT field, particularly focusing on the evaluation of specific applications:\nA) Task-Agnostic PEFT Techniques:\nFuture research should focus on developing PEFT methods that are universally applicable across different downstream tasks. This would reduce the necessity for specialized adaptors in each application domain, enhancing the flexibility and ease of PEFT deployment. Exploring meta-learning or transferable parameter approaches may achieve task-agnostic efficacy.\nB) Privacy-Preserving PEFT for Sensitive Data:\nIn fields such as biomedical imaging where data privacy is crucial, it is essential to adapt PEFT to operate on sensitive datasets without breaching patient confidentiality. Exploring federated learning or homomorphic encryption techniques could allow for privacy-preserving PEFT.\nC) Limited Labeled Data and PEFT:\nGiven the frequent scarcity of labeled data in domains like biomedical imaging, enhancing the robustness of PEFT in these contexts is critical. Future investigations could consider active learning or curriculum learning techniques to improve fine-tuning under limited data conditions.\nD) Interpretability of Fine-Tuned Protein Models:\nWhile PEFT reduces the parameter count in protein models, its impact on model interpretability remains uncertain. Future research should examine methods to elucidate the decision-making processes and mechanisms within these fine-tuned models.\nBy addressing these future research directions, we can fully harness the capabilities of PEFT, ensuring its progressive development for efficient and effective fine-tuning of large models across diverse applications."
