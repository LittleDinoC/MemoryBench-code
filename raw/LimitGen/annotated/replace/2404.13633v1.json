    "abstract": "The ubiquity of smartphones has led to an increase in on demand healthcare being supplied. For example, people can share their illness-related experiences with others similar to themselves, and healthcare experts can offer advice for better treatment and care for remediable, terminal and mental illnesses. As well as this human-to-human communication, there has been an increased use of human-to-computer digital health messaging, such as chatbots. These can prove advantageous as they offer synchronous and anonymous feedback without the need for a human conversational partner. However, there are many subtleties involved in human conversation that a computer agent may not properly exhibit. For example, there are various conversational styles, etiquettes, politeness strategies or empathic responses that need to be chosen appropriately for the conversation. Encouragingly, computers are social actors (CASA) posits that people apply the same social norms to computers as they would do to people. On from this, previous studies have focused on applying conversational strategies to computer agents to make them embody more favourable human characteristics. However, if a computer agent fails in this regard it can lead to negative reactions from users. Therefore, in this dissertation we describe a series of studies we carried out to lead to more effective human-to-computer digital health messaging.",

            "text": "As part of a healthy lifestyle and to avoid chronic diseases, it is recommended that we adhere to various health guidelines [263  ###reference_b263###, 105  ###reference_b105###, 134  ###reference_b134###, 282  ###reference_b282###, 229  ###reference_b229###].\nThese could include getting sufficient exercise [263  ###reference_b263###, 105  ###reference_b105###], eating a balanced and healthy diet [134  ###reference_b134###, 282  ###reference_b282###],\nflossing our teeth [272  ###reference_b272###, 121  ###reference_b121###, 68  ###reference_b68###]\nor getting enough sleep [229  ###reference_b229###].\nTo help us adhere to these recommendations, we can turn to social support: the provision of assistance or comfort, such as sharing advice or emotional support [284  ###reference_b284###, 32  ###reference_b32###].\nSocial support can help us perform more healthy behaviours [32  ###reference_b32###, 65  ###reference_b65###], in part by improving our motivation [267  ###reference_b267###] and self-efficacy [93  ###reference_b93###].\nTraditionally, this social support would come from human connections such as health experts, friends, or family [124  ###reference_b124###], and could be provided in person or via messages [39  ###reference_b39###].\nHowever, this support pool is finite and may not be readily available to everyone due to lack of social connections, financial constraints, or time constraints [103  ###reference_b103###].\nFortunately, a solution to this gap in human support can come from the use of health messaging technologies [3  ###reference_b3###, 298  ###reference_b298###, 18  ###reference_b18###], which can provide immediacy in their responses to users [245  ###reference_b245###].\nHealth messaging technologies are already publicly available [325  ###reference_b325###, 312  ###reference_b312###, 61  ###reference_b61###], and could message users via nudging interventions (e.g., push-notifications to remind someone to exercise [254  ###reference_b254###, 120  ###reference_b120###, 130  ###reference_b130###]), or via longer two-way conversations (e.g., chatbots to discuss someone’s cancer treatment [47  ###reference_b47###, 22  ###reference_b22###]).\nAdditionally, the technology that makes this possible is becoming accessible to more people, and (as of 2020) nearly 50% of the world population owns a smartphone [227  ###reference_b227###].\nThis gives the option for low-cost and highly accessible support for people with their health needs [245  ###reference_b245###, 170  ###reference_b170###], as the technology is scalable provided that infrastructure (reliable Internet or phone service) exists.\nFurthermore, health messaging technologies have seen some acceptance among both end-users [219  ###reference_b219###, 125  ###reference_b125###, 130  ###reference_b130###] (such as chatbots for anonymous symptom sharing [219  ###reference_b219###]) and medical professionals [236  ###reference_b236###] (such as for information sharing and appointment scheduling).\nHowever, both physicians and consumers have raised lack of empathy and inability to understand human emotions as potential barriers to engagement with health messaging technology [219  ###reference_b219###, 236  ###reference_b236###].\nThese concerns lead us to a potential impasse. Namely, the question of “How should technology communicate with us?”.\nWe want technology which people perceive as understanding their emotions and that responds empathetically.\nHowever, we do not want technology that enters the uncanny valley [137  ###reference_b137###, 330  ###reference_b330###, 290  ###reference_b290###] where communication is seen as almost human-like, but something is not quite right.\nEqually we do not want technology that responds in a way seen as inappropriate to a given situation [72  ###reference_b72###, 56  ###reference_b56###].\nFor example, users may find it less appropriate if a chatbot uses a casual conversational style when discussing their sensitive health information [72  ###reference_b72###].\nIn this case conversational style is an example of a social cue, a signal that saliently conveys meaning to people and leads them to apply social rules, expectations and scripts to interactions [101  ###reference_b101###].\nSocial cues can be split into those that are verbal cues (such as conversational style [72  ###reference_b72###] and conversational content [71  ###reference_b71###, 74  ###"

            "text": "Crowdsourcing has been used to harness the power of human creativity at scale to perform creative work such as text editing [20, 64, 276], iterating designs [91], and information synthesis [198]. In such tasks, empowering crowd workers to ideate effectively and creatively is key to achieving high-quality results. Different prompting techniques have been proposed to stimulate creativity and improve the diversity of ideas [5, 91], but they suffer from ideation redundancy, where multiple users express identical or similar ideas [28, 165, 261, 279]. Current efforts to avoid redundancy include iterative or adaptive task workflows [341], constructing a taxonomy of the idea space [145], and visualizing a concept map of peer ideas [279], but these require much manual effort and are not scalable.\n\nInstead, we propose an automatic prompt selection mechanism — Directed Diversity — to scale crowd ideation diversity. Directed Diversity composes prompts with one or more phrases to stimulate ideation. It helps to direct workers towards new ideas and away from existing ideas with the workflow: 1) extract phrases from text corpuses in a target domain, 2) embed phrases into a vector embedding, and 3) automatically select phrases for maximum diversity. These phrases are then shown as prompts to ideators to stimulate ideation. The phrase embedding uses the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) [46] to position phrases within an embedding vector space. Using the embedding vectors, we calculated distances between phrases to optimally select phrases that are farthest apart from one another; this maximizes the diversity of the selected phrases. Hence, Directed Diversity guides ideators towards under-utilized phrases or away from existing or undesirable phrases.\n\nThe embedding space provides a basis to calculate quantitative, distance-based metrics to estimate diversity in selected phrases and prompts, and subsequently ideated messages. These metrics can complement empirical measurements from user studies to evaluate prompts and ideations. We curate multiple measures and evaluation techniques and propose a Diversity Prompting Evaluation Framework to evaluate perceived and subjective creativity and objective, computed creativity, and diversity of crowd ideations. We demonstrate the framework with experiments on Directed Diversity to 1) evaluate its efficacy to select diverse prompts in a simulation study, 2) measure the perceived diversity of selected prompts and effort to generate ideas in an ideation study, and 3) evaluate the creativity and diversity of generated ideas in validation studies using quantitative and qualitative analyses. The experiments were conducted with a use case unrelated to motivational messaging, though we discuss how Directed Diversity can apply to other crowd ideation tasks. In summary, our contributions are:\n\nWe present Directed Diversity, a corpus-driven, automatic approach that leverages embedding distances based on a language model to select diverse phrases by maximizing a diversity metric. Using these constrained prompts, crowdworkers are directed to generate more diverse ideas. This results in improved collective creativity and reduced redundancy.\n\nA Diversity Prompting Evaluation Framework to evaluate the efficacy of diversity prompting along an ideation chain. This draws constructs from creativity and diversity literature, metrics computed from a language model embedding, and is validated with statistical and qualitative analyses.\n\nWe applied the evaluation framework in a series of four experiments to evaluate Directed Diversity for prompt selection, and found that it can improve ideation diversity without compromising ideation quality, but at a cost of higher user effort."

            "text": "Chatbots can be used to replace the function of surveys and interviews as a form of data collection [332  ###reference_b332###, 161  ###reference_b161###].\nIn doing so, chatbots harness some of the advantages of surveys such as scalability and low-cost [245  ###reference_b245###]; as well as some of the advantages of human interviews such as dialogue based interactions, and human-like characteristics.\nHowever, user attitudes towards chatbots may be sculpted by their expectations of the most appropriate conversational style, and using the wrong conversational style for a given situation can lead to user frustration [97  ###reference_b97###, 58  ###reference_b58###].\nTo overcome this issue, previous work has built upon the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm [220  ###reference_b220###], which asserts that people apply social norms from human interactions when interacting with computer agents.\nThis has led to the design of conversational agents that exhibit human-like characteristics that users perceive more positively.\nFor example, previous work has investigated the use of different conversational styles when requesting information [321  ###reference_b321###, 138  ###reference_b138###, 24  ###reference_b24###, 23  ###reference_b23###],\nand the use of self-disclosing chatbots to encourage reciprocated user self-disclosure [181  ###reference_b181###, 2  ###reference_b2###, 217  ###reference_b217###].\nDespite this, the effect of a chatbot’s language formality on the quality of a user’s self-disclosure has not been investigated.\nPrevious work has already produced some conflicting results regarding the formality of a chatbot’s utterances.\nFor example, participants criticised a HIV chatbot for being overly formal and dissimilar to how people normally talk when using chat applications [316  ###reference_b316###].\nIn contrast, users noted that the tone of a chatbot to perform financial services was too informal and not serious enough given the task at hand [92  ###reference_b92###].\nIn studies more analogous to self-disclosure, it has been found that chatbots exhibiting a casual conversational style can lead to higher quality collection of multiple choice responses compared to standardised surveys [322  ###reference_b322###, 45  ###reference_b45###, 161  ###reference_b161###].\nYet, these studies did not explicitly compare different levels of language formality, and instead compared the script from a standardised (non-conversational) survey against a casual (conversational) script.\nThus, these studies motivate an interesting issue, and inspire the high-level research question for our paper:\nRQ2: How does the conversational style (i.e., language formality) of a health chatbot affect the quality of a user’s self-disclosure?\nTo evaluate this question, we carried out two experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).\nBoth studies investigated the impact of using either a casual or (comparatively) formal conversational style, and we used an objective measure of language formality [135  ###reference_b135###] to design chatbot scripts.\nBoth studies are motivated similarly at a high-level to investigate the effect of a chatbot’s language formality on self-disclosure; with Study 1  ###reference_###investigating likelihood to disclose information, and Study 2  ###reference_### investigating the quality of user utterances (and thereby the quality of self-disclosure to the chatbot).\nSpecifically, in Study 1 () we measured user perceptions and the likelihood of information disclosure while varying the information requested by the chatbot by its domain (health vs non-health information) and information sensitivity (sensitive vs non-sensitive information).\nWe used empirically validated levels of information sensitivity to differentiate our levels [202  ###reference_b202###], and (as we did not want to collect user’s sensitive information) we conducted a hypothetical scenario-driven experiment where participants indicated their likelihood to disclose information to the chatbot (similarly to [294  ###reference_b294###]).\nThe findings of Study 1 indicated the benefits of varying a chatbot’s language formality when requesting health information.\nHowever, as these findings were hypothetical, it motivated us to conduct Study 2 () where we analysed the quality of user utterances when people discuss health behaviours with a chatbot.\nFrom our two user studies, we found evidence that chatbots related to the health domain could benefit by adopting a more formal conversational style.\nSpecifically, Study 1 found that when a chatbot elicits sensitive health information, users perceive a formal conversational style as more competent and appropriate than a comparatively casual style.\nStudy 2 found that a chatbot that adopts a formal conversational style elicits higher quality user utterances compared to a comparatively casual conversational style."

For example, people may be less willing to disclose socially undesirable behaviours due to embarrassment [310  ###reference_b310###], and users of mHealth services have reported that concerns over use of their personal data can negatively impact service adoption and satisfaction [127  ###reference_b127###].\nThe Personalization Privacy Paradox may hold additional uncertainty when chatbot designers need to choose an appropriate referencing format given the range of styles available to them [346  ###reference_b346###, 96  ###reference_b96###, 43  ###reference_b43###, 329  ###reference_b329###]111See [329  ###reference_b329###] for a summary of the four main types of quotation from linguistics literature..\nTo explore this paradox, we investigated the level of social presence used when a chatbot references a user’s utterances, and its effect on both how privacy violating, and positively (e.g., intelligent, engaging) users perceived the chatbot.\nSpecifically, we compared 3 referencing formats from low social presence (not explicitly referencing user utterances) to higher social presence (referencing user utterances either verbatim or via paraphrases).\nWe conducted a between-subjects longitudinal study () where participants talked to a chatbot about their dental flossing once a week for three weeks. Participants talked to a chatbot that either: (1-None) did not explicitly reference their previous week’s utterances, (2-Verbatim) referenced their previous week’s utterances verbatim (e.g.., “Last week you said “My teeth sometimes hurt when I floss””), or (3-Paraphrase) referenced their previous week’s utterances using paraphrases (e.g., “Last week you said that your teeth hurt”).\nUsers found chatbots that explicitly referenced their past utterances more intelligent and engaging.\nHowever, explicitly referencing a user’s past utterances also lead to increased feelings of privacy violations.\nTo gain further insights as to why users might have perceived chatbot referencing formats differently, we conducted semi-structured interviews ().\nFinally, we discuss implications and provide recommendations for chatbot designers when scripting interactions that reference user utterances.\n###figure_1###"

These more abstract concepts may require human input or feedback (such as labelled datasets and example utterances, or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [347  ###reference_b347###]) to ensure that computer-delivered messaging systems can reply appropriately.\nAdditionally, LLMs require a flow of example utterances (such as purposely crowd-sourced content, or extracted online content) to keep up to date with changing cultural references, slang, humour and language style.\nPrompt engineering and human judgement could also be used to produce and provide feedback on the appropriateness of responses [35  ###reference_b35###] (such as asking GPT-4 to write and evaluate its own message - see Figure 1.8 in [35  ###reference_b35###]).\nIn recent work, Karinshak et al. [159  ###reference_b159###] used GPT-3 to generate messages to encourage people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Subsequently, crowd-workers found that messages generated by GPT-3 were more persuasive than those from the CDC.\nThis early work indicates that health messaging generated using commercially available LLMs could prove fruitful (although it should be noted that the LLM produced messages explicitly referenced the authority of the CDC, whereas CDC messages did not explicitly reference their own authority within their messages).\nCegin et al. [44  ###reference_b44###] found that ChatGPT could generate more diverse paraphrases than the crowd.\nIt has also been found that LLMs function better with few-shot prompts (i.e., instructions alongside example output) [34  ###reference_b34###] rather than using zero-shot prompts (with no examples), indicating that crowdsourcing instructions (which often include specific language and examples) could be useful for LLM prompts.\nBuilding on this, it could seem that (beyond some current limitations) LLMs could be used to generate health content as an alternative to the crowd.\nTo investigate this (inevitable) future direction further, we used instructions given to the crowd (both with our own Directed Diversity [74  ###reference_b74###, 69  ###reference_b69###] method, as well as other crowdsourcing work [79  ###reference_b79###, 6  ###reference_b6###]) to generate health content.\nAs described in Chapter 3  ###reference_###, a variety of techniques have been used to help the crowd generate high-quality and diverse content.\nThese instructions to the crowd, attempt to include clear and unambiguous instructions and guidelines in order to have crowd-workers produce content to a similar quality to that of a health expert [80  ###reference_b80###, 5  ###reference_b5###].\nTaking advantage of these existing instructions, we will investigate the use of LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT-4) to generate health content using a number of different crowdsourcing techniques to assist in prompting.\nPlease see Appendix Section C  ###reference_### for prompts used with ChatGPT-4 and health content produced."
