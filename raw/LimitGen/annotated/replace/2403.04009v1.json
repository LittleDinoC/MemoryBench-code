    "title": "Media Bias Matters: Understanding the Impact of Politically Biased News on Vaccine Attitudes in Social Media",
    "abstract": "News media has been utilized as a political tool to stray from facts, presenting biased claims without evidence. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, politically biased news (PBN) has significantly undermined public trust in vaccines, despite strong medical evidence supporting their efficacy. In this paper, we analyze: (i) how inherent vaccine stances subtly influence individuals’ selection of news sources and participation in social media discussions; and (ii) the impact of exposure to PBN on users’ attitudes toward vaccines. In doing so, we first curate a comprehensive dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that connects PBN with related social media discourse. Utilizing advanced deep learning and causal inference techniques, we reveal distinct user behaviors between social media groups with various vaccine stances. Moreover, we observe that individuals with moderate stances, particularly the vaccine-hesitant majority, are more vulnerable to the influence of PBN compared to those with extreme views. Our findings provide critical insights to foster this line of research.",

            "text": "The pervasive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic transcends geographic and social boundaries Haleem et al. (2020  ###reference_b18###), having claimed over 7 million lives globally as of February 2024. Although vaccination emerges as the most efficacious defense, a substantial proportion of the population has shown vaccine hesitancy Dror et al. (2020  ###reference_b11###). A KFF survey Kirzinger et al. (2021  ###reference_b23###) reported that more than 40% of parents in the U.S. are hesitant to get their children vaccinated due to safety and efficacy concerns. Meanwhile, hundreds of mainstream media are responsible for publishing COVID-related politically biased news (PBN), turning the vaccine campaign into a political campaign Bolsen and Palm (2022  ###reference_b3###). While the skepticism around vaccines isn’t new, when intertwined with news media, it exacerbates polarized opinions and conspiracy theories, thereby posing substantial challenges to public health efforts Sorell and Butler (2022  ###reference_b46###).\n\nRecent research has examined the impact of news coverage Le Quéré et al. (2022 ###reference_b24###), political polarization Ebeling et al. (2022  ###reference_b12###), and misinformation dissemination in social media Miyazaki et al. (2023  ###reference_b33###). However, few efforts have been focused on: (i) providing a comprehensive dataset that connects news media data with associated social media data; and (ii) understanding the causal relationship between exposure to PBN and people’s vaccine stance changes. Most existing works Joseph et al. (2022  ###reference_b22###); Poddar et al. (2022  ###reference_b38###); Spiteri (2021  ###reference_b47###) studied their correlation instead of causation, the latter of which is the key to understanding the impact of a PBN intervention (i.e., reading a COVID-vaccine-related PBN) on the outcome (i.e., COVID-19 vaccine stance changes).\n\nWhile Fowler et al. (2022 ###reference_b14###) examined the causal relationship via surveys, it is limited to a small sample size and overlooks potential confounders such as user heterogeneity and social media features related to treatment and outcome. Modeling confounders is challenging due to the scarcity of observational data and domain knowledge. Moreover, little existing work differentiates the causal effect of groups with various vaccine stances. Large-scale studies on social media can complement prior research in the field to better understand how PBN shapes people’s stances toward vaccines.\n\nTo address the aforementioned limitations and challenges, we utilize the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a prominent resource containing a wide array of datasets for empirical research. Leveraging this repository, we propose a research pipeline (see Figure 1  ###reference_###) to study the following research questions:\nRQ1: How do PBN consumption and social media discussion vary with different vaccine stance groups?\nRQ2: To what extent does PBN exposure contribute to the reversal and reinforcement of vaccine stances?\n\nIn summary, this study makes the following contributions to systematically address the posed research questions:\nDataset Curation: We draw on the UCI Machine Learning Repository to select suitable datasets that help establish connections between COVID-related PBN and social media data, thus enabling future research by providing rich resources.\nBehavior Analysis: We characterize pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, and vaccine-hesitant groups on Twitter. We delve into the differences in PBN consumption preference and social media discussions across these groups.\nCausal Effect Estimation: We employ advanced causal learning methods to estimate the causal effect of reading PBN on users’ vaccine stance changes.\n\nOur observations reveal that the three vaccine stance groups demonstrate significantly different user behaviors. Meanwhile, exposure to left-leaning and right-leaning news sources generally causes social media users to be more pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine, respectively. Notably, users who are hesitant about vaccination show a greater vulnerability to the influence of PBN, underscoring the significant challenges faced in promoting vaccination campaigns."

            "text": "Political bias in news media has been studied extensively in the areas of political science, social science, etc Eberl et al. (2017  ###reference_b13###). It is an inherent bias of journalists and media outlets that makes them intentionally report biased news articles in order to serve a political agenda. The alteration of the news content usually operates in two ways: (i) issue framing, i.e., presenting an issue in a way that will likely get the most agreement from supporters; and (ii) issue filtering, i.e., selectively omit information that supports an alternative opinion on the other political side Iyengar (1994  ###reference_b20###). As a result, readers were manipulated by misleading or false viewpoints and narratives. Prior work examining political bias using both qualitative and quantitative methods, has shown that U.S. news media differs ideologically and can create a highly polarized social environment Budak et al. (2016  ###reference_b4###). During the COVID-19 pandemic, much scholarly attention has been devoted to understanding the influence of PBN on public health. For example, some have shown that misleading information downplays the severity of COVID Teng et al. (2022  ###reference_b49###), false claims prevent people from knowing the fact Seo et al. (2022  ###reference_b43###), and conspiracy communities use PBN to distance users from science Sharma et al. (2022  ###reference_b44###)."

Besides, another line of research has been devoted to collecting COVID-vaccine-related datasets from news media. Semeraro et al. (2022  ###reference_b42###) collected 5,745 news from 17 Italian news media. Joseph et al. (2022  ###reference_b22###) collected 750k articles from over 300 local news outlets to analyze relations between news coverage and offline behaviors. However, little prior work provided labeled datasets of COVID-vaccine-related PBN and social media discussion. To bridge this gap, our dataset combines both social media (e.g., tweets) and news media (e.g., news articles) data with multi-level manual and algorithmic annotations on news articles, posts, and users."

For each news article, the rating process includes (i) editorial review, (ii) blind bias survey, (iii) independent review, (iv) third-party review, (v) community feedback, and (vi) confidence level.333https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-rating-methods  ###reference_bias-rating-methods### However, both data sources (Allsides and Twitter) do not provide human-annotated labels on COVID-19 vaccine stances. As it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task to annotate vaccine stances for the entire collected dataset with 2,196 news articles and 243,412,961 tweets, we follow the method mentioned in Lyu et al. (2022  ###reference_b26###) and leverage a human-in-the-loop machine-learning strategy to minimize the manual annotation effort meanwhile maintaining high-quality labels.\nSpecifically, we first identify common COVID-related keywords (covid, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2) to filter out news articles and tweets unrelated to COVID-19. After that, we invite two annotators in the area to inspect the headline and content to assign one of the four labels for each news article:\nPro-vaccine, i.e., news that promotes the willingness of vaccine acceptance and uptake;\nAnti-vaccine, i.e., news that discourages the willingness of vaccine acceptance and uptake;\nMixed, i.e., news that contains controversial opinions about COVID-19 vaccines; and\nOther, i.e., news that contains general COVID-19 information, but are unrelated to vaccines.\nBefore annotating, we inform the annotators of a few examples of each category. With the collected annotations, we calculate Cohen’s Kappa Score () to assess the inter-annotator agreement for the selected PBN dataset. We get  = 0.83, which is considered “almost perfect” agreement according to Cohen (1960  ###reference_b8###). To further obtain the ground truth, we only considered the annotations that both annotators agreed on. This results in 410 pro-vaccine, 395 anti-vaccine, 409 mixed, and 772 other news articles.\nFor our large-scale Twitter dataset, we finetune a pre-trained CT-BERT Müller et al. (2020  ###reference_b35###) on three publicly available Twitter datasets for COVID-19 vaccine stance detection Glandt et al. (2021  ###reference_b15###); Cotfas et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###); Jiang et al. (2023  ###reference_b21###). The final downstream task is designed to be a binary classification, i.e., infer the stance of COVID-vaccine-related tweets as pro-vaccine (+1) or anti-vaccine (-1). Our final model achieves a high F1 score and accuracy, yielding respectively 0.833 and 0.845. To further evaluate our dataset’s final model, we adopt a set of COVID-vaccine-stance-related keywords from CoVaxxy DeVerna et al. (2021  ###reference_b10###) to extract relevant tweets. Then we manually check the machine-generated stance labels. Specifically, we randomly select 500 COVID-vaccine-related tweets (250 pro-vaccine and 250 anti-vaccine) from our dataset and manually annotate them. Algorithmic and manual annotations have a “almost perfect” agreement with Cohen’s Kappa Score  = 0.84. This suggests that the final model is capable and reliable in labeling the rest COVID-vaccine-related tweets in our dataset."

            "text": "People with different vaccine stances can have different news consumption behaviors, e.g., pro-vaxxers read more news from the left-leaning media. How they react to a PBN reading intervention may also differ significantly. Therefore, it is critical to identify groups with different vaccine stances to mitigate potential selection and sampling bias. In this section, we (i) categorize users into anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and vaccine-hesitant groups and then (ii) compare their PBN consumption behaviors and social media discussions.\nBased on a study from the SAGE working group MacDonald and others (2015  ###reference_b28###), vaccine hesitancy occurs on the continuum between two extremes, i.e., completely accepting (pro-vaccine) and refusing all vaccines (anti-vaccine). Intuitively, vaccine-hesitant users change their stances more frequently compared to anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers. Therefore, we first calculate the monthly COVID-vaccine stance changes:\nNote that  and  denote the number of pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine tweets before a user reads PBN, respectively. Similar to Mitra et al. (2016  ###reference_b32###), we then determine three types of vaccine stance groups based on the following criteria:\npro-vaccine group, users whose monthly COVID-19 vaccine  are always greater than 0.8;\nanti-vaccine group, users whose monthly COVID-19 vaccine  are always less than -0.8; and\nvaccine-hesitant group, users whose monthly COVID-19 vaccine  are changing between 0.8 and -0.8.\nIn total, we identify 2,377 pro-vaccine, 1,238 anti-vaccine, and 10,428 vaccine-hesitant users.\nNext, we compare the selection bias of three types of news sources in the pro-vaccine group, anti-vaccine group, and vaccine-hesitant group in Figure 3  ###reference_###. A notable observation is that the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine groups display a highly unbalanced distribution compared to the vaccine-hesitant group. Left-leaning and right-leaning news dominate among the pro-vaccine (around 75%) and anti-vaccine groups (around 91%), respectively. Meanwhile, users in the vaccine-hesitant group read news mainly from center-leaning (around 43%) and left-leaning (around 35%) media outlets.\n###figure_3### We further use topic modeling on the collected COVID-vaccine-related tweets to investigate topics each group is interested in after reading PBN. The text is pre-processed by punctuation removal, URL removal, stop words removal, hashtag removal, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. The cleaned data is then fed into BERTopic Grootendorst (2022  ###reference_b16###), a state-of-the-art topic modeling technique that leverages Sentence-Bert (SBERT) Reimers and Gurevych (2019  ###reference_b39###) for text embedding, UMAP McInnes et al. (2018  ###reference_b30###) for dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN McInnes et al. (2017  ###reference_b29###) for clustering, and a class-based TF-IDF for topic representation. To verify the quality of the result from BERTopic, we manually inspect representative tweets (i.e., tweets nearest to the cluster centroid) for each topic cluster. Finally, we merge over-partitioned clusters to obtain the final list of COVID-related topic clusters.\nVaccine Refusal\ndie, kill, serious, allergic, side, effect, risk, freedom\nI won’t EVER comply. #NOmasks #NOVaccine.

We find that:\n“Vaccine acceptance” (green) and “scientific argument” (blue) discussions have grown steadily in the pro-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant groups.\nPercentages of tweets about “conspiracy theories” (purple) and “vaccine refusal” (red) show a rapid increase between 2022/04 and 2022/05 in the anti-vaccine group.\nThe trending around “political discussion” (grey) of the three groups shows a similar pattern."

            "text": "One of the primary challenges in causal effect estimation with observational data is controlling for confounders. In this research question, we (i) identify two types of social media features as potential confounders: users’ statistical profile feature (e.g., number of tweets) and textual content feature (e.g., historical tweets) Veitch et al. (2020  ###reference_b50###); Cheng et al. (2022a  ###reference_b5###). With the identified potential confounders, we (i) estimate the causal effect of reading COVID-vaccine-related PBN on Twitter users’ vaccine stance changes. We hypothesize that reading COVID-vaccine-related news from left-leaning and right-leaning media will cause people’s COVID-19 vaccine stance to shift toward pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine, respectively. To validate this hypothesis, we begin by formulating the problem as a causal effect estimation task. We use causal graphs  Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###) to represent the two scenarios we consider – (1) when the causal effect is confounded only by observed variables (see Figure 4(a)  ###reference_sf1###); and (2) when there exist unobserved confounders (see Figure 4(b)  ###reference_sf2###). With them, we apply state-of-the-art causal learning methods to quantitatively estimate the causal effect using data from CovNS. We also compare the results obtained by the causal learning models and that from a correlation-based model.\nWe consider the following profile features as potential confounders:\nThe log-transformed number of historical tweets, likes, followers, and friends;\nThe 2020 U.S. presidential election results of the location, ( blue state,  red state);\nThe age (months) of the account;\nThe Twitter account is verified or not, ( unverified,  verified); and\nThe proportion of COVID-vaccine-related tweets, i.e., a continuum between 0 and 1.\nFor the textual feature, we extract the text embedding of the most recent one-week historical tweets before a user reads PBN from the fine-tuned CT-BERT. These statistical and textual features can reflect user characteristics, which are related to users’ online behaviors. Therefore, we select these important social media features as potential confounders for discovering the causal relation in the next phase.\nWe define the causal effect we aim to estimate – reading COVID-vaccine-related PBN (treatment) denoted by  on one’s COVID-vaccine stance shifting (outcome) denoted by . We represent the causal relations among variables with two different causal graphs Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###) to consider two possible scenarios (see Figure 5  ###reference_###).\nWe consider four different settings in terms of how the values of  and  are defined (see Table 3  ###reference_###).\nThen, with -calculus Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###), we define the causal estimand, i.e., the average treatment effect (ATE):\nwhere  is the expectation of  when  is intervened to take value .\nAs aforementioned, we consider the user characteristics, i.e., a set of selected profile features and user history, are related to one’s PBN consumption behavior () and change in COVID-19 vaccine stance ().\nIn scenario 1, we let the confounder  be these user characteristics. Thus, by conditioning on them, we can block the backdoor path (treatment-confounder-outcome) to handle confounding bias.\nWith Figure 4(a)  ###reference_sf1###, we assume that there is no backdoor path between  and  by conditioning on the observed user characteristics . This leads to the identification of ATE through backdoor criterion Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###):\nIn this scenario, we estimate ATE with two state-of-the-art causal learning methods. Double machine learning (DML) Chernozhukov et al. (2018  ###reference_b7###) – DML estimates heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data with machine learning algorithms. It contains two predictive tasks (i.e., predict the treatment and outcome from the confounder) to ensure unbiased estimates of the causal effect. We use a linear DML in this study.\nCausal Forest (CF) Athey et al. (2019  ###reference_b1###) – CF is widely adopted for causal effect estimation, which performs recursive partition in the confounder space s.t. each leaf of a tree in CF corresponds to a homogeneous subpopulation with similar causal effect.\nCompared to linear DML, CF models the relationship between the confounder and the treatment with a tree-based model and infers the causal effect of a test instance by looking up the treatment effect of the subpopulation this instance is mapped to.\nScenario 1 relies on a strong causal assumption that all confounders are observable/measurable (i.e., the unconfoundedness assumption Pearl (2009  ###reference_b36###)). However, in practice, some confounders are hidden or unmeasurable. For example, one’s education and occupation may not be explicitly stated in the user profile. We cannot hope to measure all possible confounders. A common practice is to adopt the “proxy variables” Cheng et al. (2022b  ###reference_b6###). For example, some textual clues from historical tweets can implicitly reflect users’ education levels and jobs. Therefore, in scenario 2, we further relax the unconfoundedness assumption and consider the observed user characteristics  as the proxies of the latent confounder . The causal graph is illustrated in Figure 4(b)  ###reference_sf2###. Then we can leverage proximal causal inference methods Miao et al. (2018  ###reference_b31###) to identify ATE.\nSpecifically, we consider Causal effect variational autoencoder\n(CEVAE) Louizos et al. (2017  ###reference_b25###) as the estimator. CEVAE leverages deep variational autoencoders (VAE) to learn the representation of the latent confounder given the observed proxy variables.\nFor comparison, we include a correlation-based method. Specifically, we implement a simple logistic regression on treatment that predicts the outcome  with the treatment  as its input. It can be considered as a generalized version of the naive estimator Rubin (1978  ###reference_b41###) that does not control the effect of confounding variables.\n###figure_6### ###figure_7### ###figure_8### ###figure_9### ###figure_10### ###figure_11### Figure 6  ###reference_### shows the comparison of the overall estimated ATE by different methods and that of the pro-vaccine group (5(b)  ###reference_sf2###), anti-vaccine group (5(c)  ###reference_sf3###), and vaccine-hesitant group (5(d)  ###reference_sf4###). The estimated ATE from DML, CF, and CEVAE are similar ().\nComparing the results from settings 1 and 2, we observe that reading PBN from left-leaning media causes individuals to be more pro-vaccine. In contrast, results from settings 3 and 4 show that consuming PBN from right-leaning media causes people to be more anti-vaccine.\nResults from logistic regression (LR) on treatment are outliers in all experiments (). For example, the estimated ATEs of LR in setting 3 show that reading right-leaning PBN will make people more pro-vaccine, which is opposite to the results from causal learning models. A possible explanation is that the results of correlation-based observational studies usually suffer from spurious correlation due to confounding bias, especially when the confounding effect is important Austin (2011  ###reference_b2###).\nIn addition, we find that the magnitudes of the estimated ATE of the vaccine-hesitant group are higher than the pro-vaccine group and anti-vaccine group, indicating that vaccine-hesitant people are more likely to change their vaccine stances after consuming PBN."

            "text": "RQ1. Users with varying stances on vaccines display unique patterns of PBN consumption and social media discussion. Future research should consider the disparity when studying vaccine-related problems in social media.\nCompared to the vaccine-hesitant people, the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine group members are more likely to read PBN from far-left and far-right news media, respectively. Intensive exposure to highly biased news may explain the occurrence of extreme COVID-19 vaccine stances.\nAs “scientific arguments” and “political narratives” usually contain debatable opinions, the vaccine-hesitant group member is able to gather diverse information from both sides. Thus, their stances may move back and forth.\nThe pattern of increasing interest in “vaccine acceptance” and a decline in “vaccine refusal” indicates that the vaccine-hesitant group is becoming more positive about the vaccine.\nRQ2. The exposure to COVID-vaccine-related news from left- and right-leaning media causes one’s COVID-19 vaccine stance shift toward pro- and anti-vaccine respectively, especially for users in the vaccine-hesitant group. This suggests that it is possible for malicious people to manipulate public opinion through PBN interventions.\nThe similar estimated causal effects from causal learning models indicate that the unobserved confounding variables may have limited impacts on the treatment and outcome.\nComparing the magnitudes of the estimated ATE (see Figure 5(a)  ###reference_sf1###), we observe that left-leaning news (setting 1 and 2) is more influential than right-leaning news (setting 3 and 4). We speculate that vaccine-hesitant people are more likely to become pro-vaxxers than anti-vaxxers over time through the influence of PBN.\nAs reading left-leaning news has a very small causal effect (around ) on anti-vaxxers’ vaccine stance changes (see Figure 5(c)  ###reference_sf3###), it is unlikely to alter anti-vaxxers to pro-vaxxers through PBN reading interventions. Meanwhile, pro-vaxxers are difficult to become anti-vaxxers by consuming PBN (see Figure 5(b)  ###reference_sf2###). This indicates that people with extreme views about vaccines tend to reinforce their existing stances. On the other hand, the vaccine-hesitant majority are vulnerable to the influence of PBN and, thus, may frequently reverse their minds."

            "text": "This paper investigates the impact of PBN consumption on the vaccine stance changes of social media users. We construct CovNS, which contains data from both news media and social media. We compare the PBN consumption behavior and social media discussion between three vaccine stance groups. By identifying potential confounders, we leverage state-of-the-art causal inference methods to estimate the causal effect. Our experiments and analyses have implications for fostering the research of vaccine hesitancy in social media. We conclude that consuming left-leaning and right-leaning news causes people to be pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine, respectively. More importantly, there is only a small possibility for anti-vaxxers to become pro-vaxxers via PBN reading interventions on social media, and vice versa."
