    "title": "AIx Speed: Playback Speed Optimization Using Listening Comprehension of Speech Recognition Models",
    "abstract": "Since humans can process visual information and analyze images quickly, we often view images and related content in a manner optimized for efficient comprehension. \n\nTo further leverage this capability, systems have been developed that automatically adjust image analysis tools according to the user’s condition and the type of content, assisting in more efficient comprehension of visual information. \n\nHowever, there is still potential to extend human image-recognition ability by enhancing systems with algorithms optimized for even finer levels of image detail and providing this enhancement to users. \n\nIn this study, we determine whether humans can process these optimized visual enhancements and propose a system that automatically adjusts image detail perception at units as small as pixel clusters while ensuring clarity. \n\nThe system uses image classification accuracy as a proxy for how well a human can analyze certain image details and maximizes image perception speed to the extent that a human can process. \n\nThis method can be used to produce clear but rapidly analyzable images. \n\nIn the evaluation experiment, we compared the images analyzed at a constant fast speed and the flexibly enhanced images generated by the proposed method in a blind test and confirmed that the proposed method produced images that were easier to analyze.",

            "text": "With the widespread use of video distribution services, people are increasingly watching videos for various purposes, including information gathering, learning, and entertainment. Humans are capable of understanding naturally observed phenomena at rates faster than the original. Therefore, when watching video or listening to audio, we often increase the playback speed of the content to understand more content in a shorter amount of time. Existing research has shown that when watching videos for learning, under certain conditions, differences in video playback speed do not affect learning effectiveness and may even improve performance (Nagahama and Morita, 2017 ###reference_b23###; Lang et al., 2020 ###reference_b17###; Murphy et al., 2022 ###reference_b22###). It has also been reported that 30% to 80% of users prefer to watch dramas at high speed, although this varies from country to country (Duan and Chen, 2019 ###reference_b7###). There are many advantages to listening to video and audio at high speeds. As a result, many methods have been proposed to automatically adjust the playback speed according to the structure of the content and the condition of the user, to further enhance the human ability to listen at high speeds. They are widely studied as video summarization (Apostolidis et al., 2021 ###reference_b2###) and audio summarization (Vartakavi et al., 2021 ###reference_b30###). There are two basic strategies to these methods. The first is to scan the user’s intentions and behavior and leave only the parts that need to be viewed or adjust the playback speed in proportion to the user’s concentration level (Kurihara, 2011 ###reference_b16###; Kawamura et al., 2014 ###reference_b14###). The second is to speed up unnecessary parts of the content (i.e., parts that do not contain speech) or slow down parts that contain speech (Kayukawa et al., 2018 ###reference_b15###; Higuchi et al., 2017 ###reference_b10###; Song et al., 2015 ###reference_b27###; Zhang et al., 2020 ###reference_b33###). However, these methods do not explicitly model whether the resulting speech at different playback speeds is intelligible to humans, so it is unclear whether a wide range of speech types can be made intelligible to users. In addition, these systems vary the playback speed for each large chunk of speech, which leaves room for adjustment regarding playback speed for smaller units of time. Therefore, we propose AIx Speed, a system that adjusts audiovisual output speed while maintaining intelligibility by measuring speech intelligibility after playback speed is increased. As shown in Fig. 1 ###reference_###, this system flexibly optimizes the playback speed in a video at the phoneme level. By utilizing the listening ability of a neural network–based speech recognition model, which is said to rival human performance (Xiong et al., 2016 ###reference_b32###), the system simultaneously maximizes the video playback speed and the speech recognition rate after changing the playback speed. In this paper, the validity of using speech recognizers as a proxy for evaluating human listening performance was tested through the correlation of changes in human and speech listening performance when speed is increased. We also examined whether speech where the playback speed is controlled at the phoneme level, as generated by the proposed method, or speech that is played at a constant speed and a high rate is easier for humans to listen to. The results showed that the utterances generated by the proposed method were easier for humans to understand. Furthermore, the experimental results confirmed that the speech of non-native speakers can be transformed into speech that is easier to understand for native speakers by speeding up the speech with AIx Speed. In summary, the proposed method not only supports the improvement of human speed–listening ability but also improves the intelligibility of speech by generating speech with adjustable playback speeds that consider the balance between playback speed and speech intelligibility. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. Demonstrates that speech recognizers can be a substitute for human listening performance assessment. Proposes a method to increase playback speed while maintaining speech intelligibility at the phoneme level. Improves the intelligibility of speech for non-native speakers by optimizing speech rate at the phoneme level. ###figure_1###"

            "text": "There are two main methods for adjusting video playback speed to improve the time efficiency of video viewing. The first is to remove unnecessary portions by focusing on the content, and the second is to retain the necessary portions based on user interaction. The former removes portions that do not have audio, which is accomplished using systems such as CinemaGazer (Kurihara, 2011  ###reference_b16###), or portions of sports games that are not highlights of the game (Kawamura et al., 2014  ###reference_b14###). The latter has been studied extensively, especially in the field of human–computer interaction (HCI), and adjusts the playback speed based on the user’s behavior. For example, SmartPlayer (Cheng et al., 2009  ###reference_b5###) learns the optimal playback speed based on a user’s past viewing history. There are also technologies that allow a user to make a rough selection in advance of what AIx Speed considers important and then fast-forward the rest of the video (Kayukawa et al., 2018  ###reference_b15###; Higuchi et al., 2017  ###reference_b10###). Others monitor the user’s movements and adjust the playback speed according to the user’s level of concentration (Song et al., 2015  ###reference_b27###) and comprehension (Zhang et al., 2020  ###reference_b33###; Nishida et al., 2022  ###reference_b24###). These technologies have the advantage of tracking the optimal playback speed for each user, but they cannot reflect important factors such as the intelligibility of the conversation in the video and its changes in the playback speed. These methods do not explicitly model whether the resulting speech is intelligible to humans when the playback speed is varied. Therefore, speeding up the playback of various types of audio and video while making the audio understandable to the user is still an open problem. In addition, these systems vary the playback speed for large chunks of speech, which leaves room for adjustment regarding the playback speed for smaller units of time. In this respect, the proposed system can adjust the playback speed in finer phoneme units and can also generate speech that is easier for the user to understand. The differences between the proposed system and the existing systems are shown in Fig. 2  ###reference_###. ###figure_2### ###figure_3### ###figure_4### ###figure_5###"

            "text": "The purpose of this study is to automate the maximization of speed to the extent that speech is understandable. To this end, we hypothesize that as the speed increases, the recognition performance of both humans and speech recognizers will decrease in the same way. If this hypothesis is correct, we can evaluate how well a human can hear when playback speed is increased using a speech recognizer instead of a human. Several attempts have been made to evaluate human hearing with speech recognizers in this way. For example, it has been shown that the results of human mean opinion score (MOS) listening tests correlate with the results of the speech recognition-based MOS estimation method introduced in (Jiang and Schulzrinne, 2002 ###reference_b12###), and in (Fontan et al., 2017 ###reference_b8###), the understanding and comprehension scores of a listener with simulated age-related hearing loss were highly correlated with a speech recognition-based system. A similar hypothesis has been used in speech learning support research to evaluate a learner’s speech ability based on speech recognition performance (Tejedor-GarcÃ­a et al., 2021 ###reference_b28###). In other words, if a speech recognizer can recognize speech, it judges that the person speaks well. However, the relationship between the machine learning model and the ability to understand human speech when the playback speed is varied, which is the focus of this study, has not been evaluated. Therefore, we first investigated whether this hypothesis is true. This study compared human listening performance and speech recognition performance for speech at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.0x playback speeds. To measure human listening performance, speech data of English sentences were prepared at each playback speed, and the subjects were asked to transcribe the data. The target English sentences were selected from Imagenet (Deng et al., 2009 ###reference_b25###), a large visual database designed to promote the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence in visual recognition tasks. This dataset contains millions of images with labels in over 20,000 categories. The participants were 140 English speakers who lived in the United States and had graduated from a US high school. All participants were recruited from the Amazon Mechanical Turk and were compensated for their time. Each subject was given 15 English sentences that had been randomly sped up by 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, or 2.0x and asked to transcribe them. The speech recognizer transcription data was collected by inputting 15 English sentences at each playback speed into a Wav2Vec2-based speech recognition model, similar to the human performance evaluation (Baevski et al., 2020 ###reference_b3###). Figure 3 ###reference_### shows a graph of the change in listening performance of the human and machine learning models when the playback speed was changed. In these figures, the horizontal axis is the playback speed, and the vertical axis is the recognition performance. Recognition performance was evaluated using character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER), which are commonly used in speech recognition (the lower these values are, the better). The WER was calculated as follows: and CER was calculated as For both the human and machine learning models, listening performance decreased as playback speed increased from 1.0x. For playback speeds greater than 1.0x, the correlation coefficient between the change in listening performance for the human and machine learning models was 0.9977. On the other hand, when the playback speed was slowed down from 1.0x, the machine learning model showed a decrease in recognition performance, but the decline was barely observable for humans. In particular, while the performance of WER decreased slowly, the performance of CER showed almost no decrease. This indicates that human recognition performance on a character-by-character basis does not drop nearly as much when listening to slowed speech. Thus, when the playback speed increased, the recognition performance of the human and machine learning models decreased similarly, but they exhibited different behavior when the playback speed was decreased. However, since this study focuses on increasing the playback speed of speech, the difference in behavior when the playback speed is slower than 1.0x has no effect. Therefore, by taking advantage of the fact that listening performance decreases as playback speed is increased for humans and speech recognition models alike, we replaced human listening performance with speech recognition performance to develop the desired system."

The speech recognition process consists of the extraction of acoustic features from the speech waveform, estimation of the classes of acoustic features for each frame, and generation of hypotheses from the sequence of class probabilities.\nSince the speech recognizer can partially share the neural network with the playback speed adjuster, the overall network size can be reduced.\nAs shown in Fig. 5  ###reference_###, the dotted speech feature extractor is shared.\nThe speech features obtained by this mechanism are used as input to generate text in the projection layer.\nIn this process, the speech recognizer is trained to minimize CTC loss, as in normal speech recognition.\nIn summary, the entire model is trained to minimize the following error function, which is a combination of this error function and the error function of the playback speed adjuster.\nHere,  is a hyperparameter that adjusts the importance of the playback speed calculation and speech recognition."

The horizontal axis is the playback time, and the vertical axis represents the playback speed output by the model for each playback time. The first is an example of speeding up a dialogue, movie, or lecture. Two speakers appear in the video, and the optimal playback speed can be set for each speaker. Of particular interest is that the two speakers in the video speak at different speeds, so the average playback speed for the two speakers is different. It can also be seen that the playback speed increases drastically from the moment when the dialog between the two speakers ends and there is no more speech from the person. Although we did not intend to design this feature, we can see that our system, like conventional playback speed controllers, can speed up the playback speed in the parts where there is no speech. The second example is speeding up the speech of non-native speakers to make it easier to understand. Since the speech of non-native speakers is often slower than that of native speakers, moderately speeding up the speech makes it easier to understand. The change in playback speed shows that the overall playback speed is faster than the speech between native speakers in the first video. This indicates that the model can speed up the speech more because the non-native speakers’ speech is slower than that of the native speakers."

We compared the CER and WER with the speech playback speed modified by the AIx Speed to the CER and WER when the speech was simply played at a constant speed. The speeds of the comparison targets were 1.0x, 1.5x and the average speed times the playback speed of AIx Speed. A standard Wav2Vec2 based speech recognition model, which was the speech recognizer used in our method, was used to compute the CER and WER for comparison. The performance of the models is shown in Table. 1 ###reference_### (a) and 1 ###reference_### (b) for Imagenet and UME-ERJ, respectively. AIx Speed produces speech 1.30 times faster on average for Imagenet and 1.29 times faster on average for UME-ERJ. Both results show that the playback speed optimized by AIx Speed has lower values for both CER and WER than the average constant speech speed at that playback speed. From these results, it can be said that the proposed model maximizes the playback speed while guaranteeing the recognition performance. In addition, for UME-ERJ, the speech generated at AIx Speed shows better recognition performance in terms of WER than at 1.0x playback speed. Therefore, it is also suggested that the proposed method can be used to convert the speech of non-native speakers into more understandable speech."
