    "title": "Argument Quality Assessment in the Age of Instruction-Following Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "The computational treatment of arguments on controversial issues has been subject to extensive NLP research due to its envisioned impact on opinion formation, decision making, writing education, and the like. A critical task in any such application is the assessment of an argument’s quality—but it is also particularly challenging. In this position paper, we start from a brief survey of argument quality research, where we identify the diversity of quality notions and the subjectiveness of their perception as the main hurdles towards substantial progress on argument quality assessment.\n\nWe argue that the capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment. Rather than just fine-tuning LLMs towards leaderboard chasing on assessment tasks, they need to be instructed systematically with argumentation theories and scenarios as well as with ways to solve argument-related problems. We discuss the real-world opportunities and ethical issues emerging thereby.\n\nKeywords: Computational Argumentation, Argument Quality, Large Language Model, Instruction Fine-Tuning",

            "text": "When learning about controversial issues, people rarely accept arguments they encounter without further contemplation. Rather, they seek to find the best arguments; those that help them form an opinion or write texts that persuade others; those that make them reach agreement or at least understand each other better. That is to say, argument quality is of interest as soon as arguments are presented to an audience. Computational argumentation aids the treatment of arguments at a larger scale, with important applications in search, business, and education. But the situation there is the same: It is not enough to mine or generate arguments; their quality also needs to be evaluable, so that it can be assessed, flaws can be found, and accounted for.\n\nResearch on argument quality assessment has organized theories and methods under various quality notions, from logical cogency to rhetorical effectiveness to dialectical reasonableness. Even though computational argumentation was just gaining momentum in natural language processing (NLP) back then, two inherent challenges of argument quality were visible already: the diversity of quality notions as well as the subjectivity of their perception and, hence, of their assessment for both humans and computational models. Consider an argumentative claim against censoring Mark Twain’s usage of the N-word. This claim is certainly relevant to the discussion, but whether people will deem it effective may strongly depend on their individual context.\n\nWhile the challenges of diversity and subjectivity prevail until today, NLP is seeing a revolutionary breakthrough with the rise of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) that can tackle various NLP tasks with little to no task-specific fine-tuning, enabled by their capability to integrate and leverage knowledge across contexts. The question is: What are the implications for argument quality assessment specifically as well as for computational argumentation in general?\n\nIn this paper, we revisit the computational assessment of argument quality in light of the availability of LLMs. Starting from the status quo, we carry out a brief survey of recent NLP research on the topic. To bring order into the various lines of research pursued, we organize them into three general directions:\n\n1. Conceptual notions of maximal and minimal argument quality,\n2. Influence factors of argument quality from the context where arguments occur, and\n3. Computational models for assessing or improving argument quality.\n\nOn this basis, we establish the central question to which we provide answers:\n\nHow to drive research on LLM-based argument quality assessment to face the prevailing challenges of diverse quality notions and their subjectivity?\n\nWe are convinced that the capabilities of instruction-following LLMs enable research to overcome many aspects of the two challenges. To this end, the primary focus of NLP research on argument quality should be put on systematic ways to teach LLMs to follow instructions, including concepts and settings of arguing in addition to ways to solve argument-related problems. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs on predefined domains and preselected theories, we expect the greatest impact to lie in teaching LLMs the theories, circumstances, and ethical constraints to adhere to. The rationale behind this is that LLMs will often have processed data from all contexts needed to make an informed judgment about an argument’s quality, due to their heavy pretraining on huge amounts of data. In contrast, LLMs cannot access, by default, the knowledge of what is to be prioritized in a given setting.\n\nWe state upfront that the blueprint delineated in this paper comes with several limitations and ethical considerations that we critically analyze. Moreover, we are aware of the general issues of LLMs, including hallucinated facts and the reproduction of common social biases. These issues deserve treatment in computational argumentation as well; they are even particularly critical due to the sensitivity of many controversial topics. Keeping this in mind, we believe that it is necessary to explore now how to best employ LLMs for argument quality assessment in order to harness their full potential for the main applications, avoiding to waste energy for the typical pursuit of leaderboard rankings on existing quality assessment tasks.\n\nNow, why is it important to discuss LLMs for argument quality assessment specifically? We address this matter when we look at the real-world opportunities emerging from the capabilities of LLMs in academia and industry. While some LLMs have been developed to tone down argumentative conversations, we postulate a contrary path: Exploiting the means of LLMs to proactively enable people to learn and better reason about controversial issues, thus contributing towards more deliberate conversations. We think that the time has come to revisit and pursue the core visions of computational argumentation research, from the overcoming of filter bubbles to the individualized mass education of learners. We sketch how these visions could be realized with the LLMs available today, before we conclude and stress ethical concerns that arise with LLMs that actively affect human views.\n\nWith the discussion in this paper, we provide two main contributions to research:\n\n- A survey of the main lines of recent research on argument quality and its assessment\n- A blueprint for impactful future research on LLMs for argument quality"

            "section_name": "2.   A Brief Survey of Recent Research",
            "text": "To start, this section briefly but systematically surveys recent NLP work on argument quality assessment. We identify three general directions, each with two main aspects, and organize the research accordingly. \n\nThe papers primarily deal with the question of what is actually meant by argument quality, considered from either of two complementary perspectives: \n\n1. Notions of maximal quality based on arguing goals such as agreement and deliberation or on preferences between different arguments.\n2. Notions of minimal quality in terms of what makes an argument evaluable or appropriate to be stated as well as how to avoid fallacies.\n\nThis direction covers papers studying (or controlling) two types of factors that influence the perception of quality beyond the content, structure, and style of the argument itself:\n\n- Argument-related factors such as the argument’s length, its structure in terms of relations between units, and revisions applied to it.\n- Context-related factors, such as the domain of the discussion, the audience addressed, and the debaters involved.\n\nFinally, some papers aim mainly at methodological novelty in the modeling of argument quality for two quality-related tasks:\n\n- Models for assessment of argument quality, capturing specificities of the task, the whole discussion, or the context of arguing.\n- Models for improvement of argument quality, targeting the need for improvement, actual optimizations, or feedback on what to improve.\n\nThe remaining papers pursue individual research directions.\n\nWe note that many of the surveyed papers do not fall under one general direction only; rather, they often have a visible focus on one of them. Contributions to influence factors and computational models are not always easy to distinguish and that, sometimes, models may rather target downstream applications. Still, the directions and aspects were agreed upon in general. \n\nIn the following, we discuss selected works from each of the general research directions. Some researchers build on the argument quality taxonomy proposed by Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), including Lauscher et al. (2020) who model the main taxonomy notions using multitask learning across Q&A, debate, and review forums. Others question the simplifying view that argument quality is about persuasion only: El Baff et al. (2018) consider the goal of agreement. Gretz et al. (2020) see argument quality as a preference relation, and Falk et al. (2021) examine its connection to deliberation. With an entirely different perspective, some papers examine what makes an argument good irrespective of topic, whereas Dumani et al. (2020) operationalize argument quality for practice in a quality-based framework for argument retrieval.\n\nPark et al. (2015) establish the notion of an argument’s evaluability, which is the prerequisite of assessing logical quality soundly. A key research line on minimal quality is the detection of fallacies: arguments with flawed or deceptive reasoning. Neural models have shown success on this deep semantic problem; some aim at ad-hominem arguments only, others at various fallacies. Persing and Ng (2017b) tackle the broader problem of spotting an argument’s weaknesses, from grammar errors to lack of objectivity and unclear justifications. More practice-oriented, Pauli et al. (2022) look at the misuse of fallacies for rhetorical appeals in online forums and fake news. Finally, Ziegenbein et al. (2023) refine the notion of appropriateness.\n\nIn terms of textual factors influencing the perceived quality of arguments, researchers explore the questionable power of length as a predictor and account for this in dataset creation. The impact on quality of internal argument structure has been investigated using the notion of organization quality in learner essays and by using annotations of argument components in business model pitches. Notions of structure within an argument are further extended through adding attributes to argument components or by comparing different revisions of the same claim.\n\nLukin et al. (2017) analyze the interaction between argumentative styles and the personality of the audience, as modeled by the Big Five traits. Similarly, Durmus and Cardie (2018) model political and religious ideologies, based on the audience’s stances on various controversial topics. Both indicate that audience-level factors often outweigh language use in their persuasive effect. Alshomary et al. (2022) assess the effect of morally-framed arguments. They find that morals are particularly successful in challenging the audience’s beliefs. Wiegmann et al. (2022) analyze stylistic and behavioral characteristics of debaters that contribute to their persuasiveness over multiple debates. Aside from debate participants, Liu et al. (2022) explore arguments on social media that are accompanied by images, highlighting the potential of multimodal approaches to quality assessment, whereas Fromm et al. (2023) generalize the contextual scope of assessment to multiple domains at the same time.\n\nMany approaches aim at specific quality notions. For example, the attentive interaction model predicts an opinion holder’s view change by detecting vulnerable regions in their reasoning and modeling its relation to a challenger’s argument."

            "text": "Beyond holistic computational argumentation (CA) surveys, certain works specifically reviewed areas related to argument generation, knowledge in CA, and the use of CA for social good. Additionally, some tutorials have addressed argument mining and its applications. In contrast, we focus on argument quality assessment.\n\nAside from our recent tutorial, the only argument quality review that we are aware of is by Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), who organized relevant literature into a taxonomy of logical, rhetorical, and dialectical quality dimensions. They discussed the diversity of quality notions and the subjectivity of their perception, both of which continue to challenge research. In this paper, we aim to explore ways to address these challenges, consistent with the authors’ conceptualization of argument quality. Our survey builds on their work, focusing on research published subsequently.\n\nBased on our experience with NLP research on CA, we cover several publication venues:\n\n- All NLP venues covered by the ACL anthology\n- Leading artificial intelligence (AI) conferences from AAAI.org and IJCAI\n- Leading information retrieval (IR) conferences, SIGIR and ECIR\n- The leading CA conference, COMMA\n\nWe used Google site search and internal searches on September 1, 2023 (updated on October 17, 2023), to gather all papers containing relevant keyword pairs. This resulted in 257 papers (202 NLP, 35 AI, 11 IR, 9 CA). We retained 119 papers dealing with the quality of natural language arguments, based on title, abstract, and skimming (98 NLP, 12 AI, 6 IR, 3 CA). To emphasize scientific novelty, we excluded surveys, tutorials, demos, shared tasks, and system papers, refining the set to 104 papers (87 NLP, 10 AI, 5 IR, 2 CA). We examined these in more detail to ensure their focus on argument quality, ultimately selecting a final set of 83 papers (69 NLP, 9 AI, 3 IR, 2 CA)."

After rechecking, the newly assigned direction did not seem adequate. \n\nIn the following, we discuss selected works from each of the general research directions.

However, we found that 24 of the 83 papers have the explicit treatment of quality notions as their main focus and 10 further papers contribute to quality notions to some extent.

Accordingly, research has dealt with the identification, modeling, and controlling of such factors and their impact on argument quality. We found that 30 of the 83 papers mainly focus on influence factors, and a further 19 papers are to some extent devoted to them. Of these, about 60% discuss argument-related factors while the rest looks at context-related factors.\n\nIn terms of textual factors influencing the perceived quality of arguments, researchers display the questionable power of length as a predictor Potash et al.

However, we found that only 21 of them actually focus on proposing novel approaches targeting either of the above-mentioned conceptual quality notions, whereas 26 other papers have such approaches as secondary contributions to support their claims with experimental results and analysis. Almost all approaches aim at the assessment of argument quality, but a few recent ones go beyond assessment, studying how to improve quality.\n\nMany approaches aim at specific quality notions. For example, the attentive interaction model of Jo et al. (2018) predicts an opinion holder’s view change by detecting vulnerable regions in their reasoning and modeling its relation to a challenger’s argument. Gleize et al. (2019) propose a Siamese neural network to assess the convincingness of evidence, while Song et al. (2020) develop a hierarchical multitask learning approach to jointly model discourse element identification and organization assessment for essay scoring. Gurcke et al. (2021) examine to what extent an argument’s logical sufficiency can be predicted based on whether its conclusion can be inferred from its premises using the generation capabilities of transformers. Kondo et al. (2021) assess the validity of an argument’s reasoning using Bayesian networks and predicate logic facilitated by argumentation schemes. A few works also look beyond single quality notions, such as Falk and Lapesa (2023) who inject knowledge about the interactions between different quality notions to improve the prediction of individual ones.\n\nWhile only a few models for improvement have been presented so far, we expect more to come soon, also seeing related efforts on topics beyond those covered in this survey Chakrabarty et al. (2021); Ihori et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022). An early attempt was made by Ke et al. (2018) who design neural models that predict the persuasiveness and other attributes of arguments in a student essay, to provide feedback to students on how to improve their arguments. Recently, Skitalinskaya and Wachsmuth (2023) identified arguments in need of improvement, leveraging complex revision-based data with transformer models. Skitalinskaya et al. (2023) go one step further, presenting the first approach to the optimization of argumentative claims. It combines neural claim rewriting with quality-based ranking."

We argue that instruction-following large language models (LLMs) have the potential to overcome many limitations, if systematic ways to teach them accordingly are established.

            "text": "Conceptually, argument quality assessment is a classification or regression problem, even if partly treated as preference learning. For decades, research in NLP relied on the traditional supervised learning paradigm for most such problems: to induce a mapping from one representational space to another using training pairs of input and output. As sketched in Figure 2, the input spaces (usually, representing natural language) and output spaces (label schemes or value ranges, such as argument quality scores) are separated thereby. This separation prevents any exchange of knowledge across spaces and across tasks. \n\nWith the shift to transformers in NLP, the learning effort is mostly reduced to the self-supervised pretraining of a language model. Under the transfer learning paradigm, only fine-tuning remains supervised, to make a model address the task it is supposed to. This way, knowledge is shared between input representations across tasks and contexts, that is, all texts ever processed affect how an input is encoded. In classification and regression, however, fine-tuning (say, of a BERT encoder with a quality scoring head) reintroduces a key restriction of traditional methods, illustrated in Figure 2: The input space is separated again from the output space, preventing models from fully leveraging knowledge acquired from solving other tasks.\n\nFine-tuning for text generation tasks keeps input and output in the same space; thereby, for example, connections between an argument and its improved version can be learned. Still, it faces a second restriction that is shown in Figure 2: The idea behind the mapping from input to output (why is an output correct for an input) remains fully implicit in the training pairs. For argument quality assessment, both restrictions imply that only those interdependencies between quality notions as well as those contextual influence factors are taken into account that are explicitly modeled or controlled by the human developer. Even though a lot of other interdependencies and factors may be well-known in argumentation theory, they are widely ignored thereby. This is where instruction-following LLMs go beyond."

As Figure 2 stresses, it does so by representing the task in the joint space of inputs and outputs across all tasks and contexts, that is, in natural language (more precisely, in the embedding space in which language is encoded and from which it is decoded). Following the instruction fine-tuning paradigm, deriving an output from an input remains a language modeling problem as well as how to operationalize the derivation. This means that all knowledge ever processed in pretraining is still accessible in principle (bounded by the technical constraints of the model). Then, the supreme capability of transformers to integrate and leverage knowledge across contexts enables instruction-following LLMs to tackle unseen tasks with no or little fine-tuning. In argument quality assessment, we can expect that most knowledge about quality notions and their interdependencies as well as about influence factors and their effect on the subjective perception of argument quality has already been processed by leading LLMs, such as Alpaca Taori et al. (2023), in their pretraining stage. It should thus be possible to learn through instructions what is important in the assessment task at hand while not ignoring interactions with the surrounding concepts of argument quality."

However, LLMs do not inherently know what to prioritize for a given task. They require specific instructions to assess argument quality reliably. Survey results provide a basis for determining what to teach LLMs for argument assessment. Instructions may include:\n\n- Arguing goals, ranging from agreement to deliberation.\n- Definitions of various quality notions, from maximal to minimal quality.\n- Specificities of audiences and debaters.\n- Background on controversial topics, including other arguments or topic relationships.\n- Ethical aspects, such as biases and cultural considerations.\n- Examples of respective assessments, following few-shot learning principles.\n\nFor example, consider a claim taken from kialo.com, where users create and refine claims and vote on their impact, which serves as gold labels. Users evaluate claims based on their persuasiveness and relevance, equally weighted. However, the mapping from claim to vote in supervised learning may lead to spurious correlations and bias. Different settings require different assessments of the same claim. Instructions could include specific scenarios, such as rating a claim’s quality in a deliberative context for someone with low literacy.\n\nThese instructions clarify the task's semantics, potentially reducing biases and spurious correlations while setting the stage for assessment and improvement. Developing optimal instructions is a task for future research; currently, the focus is on systematizing instruction fine-tuning attempts."

Such an approach could include the following stages:\n\n1. Start from a general instruction-following LLM, such as Alpaca Taori et al. (2023 ###reference_b113###).

These instructions can be manually or semi-automatically derived from various datasets and experiments covered in the surveyed papers.\n\n3. Depending on available resources, apply techniques such as reinforcement learning using human feedback Ouyang et al. (2022 ###reference_b84###), fine-tuning on self-generated instructions Wang et al. (2023b ###reference_b127###), or other proposed instruction fine-tuning mechanisms.\n\n4. Align the behavior of the instruction fine-tuned LLM on new unseen tasks using systematic prompt design, such as soft prompting Qin and Eisner (2021 ###reference_b96###) or sociodemographic prompting to emulate social profiles of debaters and audiences Beck et al. (2023 ###reference_b8###). These tasks benefit from argument-specific task-solving skills due to Step 3.\n\n5. For fact-related argument quality dimensions, such as local acceptability Wachsmuth et al. (2017b ###reference_b121###), an additional step may involve working against hallucinations by teaching the LLM to check arguments against a fact source (e.g., a knowledge base or a corpus). Factuality measures may be included in the model optimization for this purpose, assuming sources can be accessed at inference time. Many quality dimensions, however, are not inherently about facts, such as those from rhetorics Wachsmuth et al. (2017b ###reference_b121###).\n\nWe expect the resulting LLM will assess argument quality more reliably, aligned with the theories behind diverse quality notions, and will adjust to subjective viewpoints of interest. This approach offers various new opportunities for real-world applications, as discussed in the next section."

            "text": "Various ways of evaluating argument quality assessment have been pursued in prior work; particularly, there is a debate about whether quality should be assessed in absolute terms, based on a given score range, or in relative terms, comparing different arguments to one another (Wachsmuth et al. 2017a). Instruction-following LLMs might not entirely resolve the underlying issue; while they provide new means for reliable evaluation (e.g., handling of context), their generative nature may also complicate validation against some ground-truth.\n\nUltimately, a fully unified evaluation procedure may not be possible, as it depends on the available information in a given assessment setting. Rather, we propose that an evaluation procedure should ideally consider the main decisive factors of quality, as exemplified for the Huckleberry Finn claim: What quality dimension is of interest, who is the audience of the argument, and similar factors. Evaluation may occur using a careful selection of existing datasets, but new benchmarks that account for these factors may also be necessary.\n\nCriteria-wise, a mix of absolute and relative assessment seems to best approximate how humans assess quality, but this requires careful operationalization: Many argument quality dimensions imply some hard constraints, favoring an absolute part (e.g., are the argument’s premises acceptable?). However, there may not be a clear best/worst quality for an argument, which favors a relative part wherever other arguments are accessible (e.g., are the premises more acceptable than those of other arguments?). Instruction fine-tuning should prepare an LLM to manage both parts and, hence, be evaluated accordingly."

            "text": "Arguably, instruction-following LLMs generally provide great opportunities for NLP and its applications. Their wide and easy applicability, along with their often low need for task-specific training data, is particularly beneficial in the context of interdisciplinary research. With a successful realization of the blueprint delineated above, however, we explicitly see specific potential for computational argumentation applications, due to their inherent need for argument quality assessment. Partly, they bring up ethical concerns, though, that we discuss at the end of the paper.\n\nArgument search aims to find the best pros and cons on controversial topics. Unlike for debating technologies, its goal to aid self-determined opinion formation suggests not to tune towards audiences. However, argument search engines miss a reliable quality-based ranking so far, likely due to the heterogeneity of argumentative domains and genres on the web. The low training need of instruction-following LLMs may alleviate this shortcoming. In addition, the text rewriting capabilities of LLMs may be employed to optimize the presentation of arguments, or to fill gaps as needed. We expect that convincing rankings and presentations are key to making people open to argument search, enabling them to overcome filter bubbles.\n\nThe moderation of (online) content is critical to ensure healthy and productive discussions. This holds particularly for deliberative contexts, where participants should be supported in communicating their viewpoints. Effective moderation reaches a bottleneck as the scale of online discussions grows. LLMs instructed for argument quality can assist moderation efforts by detecting possible violations of community guidelines, inappropriate language, or generally low-quality arguments in discussions. This way, moderators can focus their attention on nuanced cases and appeals, optimizing efficiency and ensuring a healthier discourse. In some settings, generative LLMs could even lead a dialogue with users to provide clarifications, feedback, and improvement suggestions.\n\nLLMs may further provide individualized education to learners (e.g., students or non-native speakers) as well as to everyday writers (e.g., e-commerce customers), for instance, by giving feedback on the quality of their arguments. Instruction fine-tuning makes it easier to go beyond simple quality scoring (e.g., how clear an argument is) to targeted hints (e.g., Provide more evidence for your initial claim!). Prompted with the writing goal, LLMs may also suggest argument completions, such as missing conclusions. With these means, students may learn to reason more soundly, product reviews can become more informative, and so forth. LLMs instructed with the concrete feedback scenario (e.g., a student learning to write essays in English) will help to further individualize support and may even adjust to the specific learning need of the user.\n\nIn several other scenarios, argument quality is crucial. One example is to generate summaries of the best arguments in news articles or online discussions. Here, instruction-following LLMs can interpret the term best as needed—without any task-specific fine-tuning. In the medical domain, argument quality plays a central role for evidence-based medicine. A well-instructed LLM may assess evidence strength, thus enabling better inferences based on clinical trials or reports. Similarly, the reasonableness of arguments on health discussion online platforms may be evaluated.\n\nFurther scenarios include e-commerce. There, an LLM-based service chatbot can, for example, select arguments based on quality notions (e.g., clarity) to explain to customers why a request cannot be completed, to minimize their dissatisfaction. Argument quality may also be assessed in recommender systems to make justified suggestions based on compelling reasons.\n\nFinally, we also see great potential for diversity and subjectivity-aware instruction fine-tuning when it comes to driving fundamental research, as sketched here for two examples: interdisciplinary work at the interface of NLP and computational social science, and the methodological development driven by the need to cope with subjectivity in argument quality annotations.\n\nThe social science context adds even more diversity, including sophisticated quality notions and domain-specific language, along with new challenges, such as well-curated and annotated, but small and imbalanced datasets. Our instruction fine-tuning blueprint fits exactly such scenarios: annotation guidelines serve as instructions, highly-curated annotations as reinforcement examples, and the knowledge encoded in LLMs alleviates resource-lean issues. Additionally, the scene-setting function of instruction fine-tuning has the potential to address the deliberative goal of defining and quantifying discourse quality across contexts.\n\nThe multiple factors of subjectivity influencing argument quality perception (debater and audience beliefs, values, etc.) often limit the inter-annotator agreement. Ultimately, subjectivity is a constitutive feature of argument quality, as indicated above. Suggesting a turn towards perspectivist approaches in computational argumentation, LLMs’ perspective-taking capabilities could be a game changer for this, assuming that risks of sociodemographic prompting and stereotypes are properly dealt with."

            "text": "Argument quality assessment has become a core task in NLP research on computational argumentation, due to its importance for various applications, from debating technologies and argument search to discussion moderation and writing support. However, a reliable assessment is often hampered by the diversity of quality notions involved and the subjectivity of their perception. In this survey-based position paper, we have raised the question of how to drive research on instruction-following large language models (LLMs) for argument quality to substantially evolve the state of the art.\n\nOur survey of 83 recent papers confirms that argument quality research often targets conceptual quality notions and the factors that influence these notions, aside from the computational assessment and improvement of argument quality. We have argued that many limitations of prior work can be overcome if systematic ways to instruct LLMs for argument quality during instruction fine-tuning are found. This is due to the fact that instruction-following LLMs, for the first time in machine learning-based NLP research, make the connection between inputs and outputs of tasks explicit, namely, through the instructions. Thereby, all knowledge that an LLM has processed during pretraining and fine-tuning can be shared across tasks and contexts.\n\nTo guide future work in this direction, we have delineated a blueprint of how to approach the instruction fine-tuning process. Realizations of this process will likely bring up further problems, not all are foreseeable at this point. Moreover, LLMs that effectively predict human perception of argument quality directly raise concerns, as detailed in our ethics statement below. Still, we are confident that coordinated efforts towards sustainable research on LLMs for argument quality will enable the community to progress on core visions of computational argumentation—whether it is about ways to overcome filter bubbles or about the individualized support of argumentation learners. The paper at hand seeks to lay the ground for this research."

            "text": "The discussed potential we see is based on our survey of argument quality research (Section 2  ###reference_###), initial works of the emerging body of instruction fine-tuning research (e.g., Peng et al., 2023  ###reference_b90###), and our own preliminary tests. Yet, the work at hand remains a position paper, meaning that experimental research still needs to establish whether the outlined blueprint or similar paths will actually result in substantial progress. It is possible that argument-specific instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) does not improve over the capabilities of a general large-scale tuning. Also, the systematic ways that we have proposed to establish above remain to be found; there is no obvious way of directly obtaining them. This challenge is in line with the overall state of instruction fine-tuning research, both in academia and in industry.\nRegarding the specific challenges of argument quality raised in Section 1  ###reference_###, another limitation refers to general possibility that information required to achieve a realiable assessment is simply not available, due to specificities of the setting or underlying privacy regulations. This particularly includes the audience whose quality perception is to be represented, but possibly also aspects of the (temporal, geographical, and social) context in which an argument is to be considered. Also, as soon as we rely on human-created training data for instruction fine-tuning, the creators’ biases and values affect its impact. Ultimately, we cannot expect LLMs to tackle a task reliably under conditions that simply do not suffice to make an informed judgment."

            "text": "Many arising ethical issues of the use of LLMs for argument quality assessment are general and not specific to computational argumentation, such as the increased environmental impact of bigger models, privacy issues, hallucinations, the potential of models to encode unfair exclusive Dev et al. (2021  ###reference_b20###); Lauscher et al. (2022a  ###reference_b67###) and stereotypical biases Blodgett et al. (2020  ###reference_b10###), which may result in allocational and representational harms (Barocas et al., 2017  ###reference_b7###). However, we believe that some of them deserve specific attention in scenarios where argument quality is assessed or optimized, particularly when leveraging the power of LLMs.\nIn particular, argument quality assessment may be used in sensitive applications such as digital education; for example, to support argumentative writing or to provide guidance on political opinion formation. For such applications, factual errors are particularly problematic, as they may easily lead to wrong or shifted beliefs. Whenever LLMs may generate argumentative content, say, for debating technologies or to fill gaps in argument search as discussed, extra measures should thus be taken to prevent hallucinations. We have sketched how to generally account for them in Section 3  ###reference_###, but fully avoiding them may be hard given how LLMs work.\nSimilarly, unfair social biases are easy to perpetuate in such applications, since the output of LLMs for argument quality assessment will often directly affect human views. This raises various integral and partly self-referential questions, such as who decides on what makes a good argument, or, how to decide on the ethical uses of instruction-following LLMs in argument quality assessment? We expect that universally-accepted answers to these questions may not exist, as they also depend on the values within a culture or society.\nAs the limitations discussed above imply, further ethical concerns refer to the tension between the inclusion of audience and debater information for a more accurate quality assessment. While an argument’s persuasive effect is, for instance, highly dependent on the sociodemographic aspects of its audience, it is questionable in general to what extent an application of respective methods should have access to personal data. Such aspects need to be handled with care, and under consultation with an ethics board, where needed.\nFor a successful and societal beneficial use of instruction-following LLMs, we thus conclude that future research on argument quality assessment needs to find answers to such questions and to proactively raise and discuss them explicitly."
