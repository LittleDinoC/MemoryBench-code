    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive computational study of the under-investigated phenomenon of personal name compounds (PNCs) in German such as Willkommens-Merkel (‘Welcome-Merkel’). Prevalent in news, social media, and political discourse, PNCs are hypothesized to exhibit an evaluative function that is reflected in a more positive or negative perception as compared to the respective personal full name (such as Angela Merkel). We model 321 PNCs and their corresponding full names at discourse level, and show that PNCs bear an evaluative nature that can be captured through a variety of computational methods. We further enrich our data with personal, domain-specific, and extra-linguistic information and perform a range of regression analyses revealing that factors including compound and modifier valence, domain, and political party membership influence how a PNC is evaluated. \n\nKeywords: Multiword Expressions & Collocations, Semantics, Statistical and Machine Learning Models",

            "text": "Personal name compounds (PNCs) such as Willkommens-Merkel (‘Welcome-Merkel’), Chaos-Johnson (‘Chaos-Johnson’) and Tore-Klose (‘Goal-Klose’) are nominal compounds that consist of a modifier such as Willkommen (‘Welcome’) and a personal name such as Merkel. PNCs are compositions that refer to a person, in our example the former German chancellor Angela Merkel. With few exceptions Wildgen (1981  ###reference_b36###); Kürschner (2020  ###reference_b19###), PNCs have not received much attention from the theoretical or computational perspectives, but recent work suggests that they represent a rather frequent phenomenon and carry an evaluative function with regard to the reference person Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###); Belosevic (2022  ###reference_b3###). That is, for a specific PNC in its discourse, we hypothesize that the PNC is perceived as either more positively or as more negatively than the corresponding full name. For understanding and generating texts from and for domains where real-world people are talked about (such as the news, social media, and any kind of political discourse, as well as for related tasks including sentiment and emotion analysis) it is thus particularly relevant to explore the evaluative nature and discourse effects of PNCs. This paper performs such an investigation: we leverage and extend an existing dataset consisting of German PNCs and their corresponding full names from the domains politics, sports, show business, and others Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###). To assess PNCs in their contexts, we build a corpus drawing on data from social media (Twitter) and German news (Deutscher Wortschatz). We then draw on the notion of valence from psycholinguistics that determines the pleasantness of a stimulus. Valence is considered one of the principal dimensions of affect and cognitive heuristics that shape human bias and attitude Harmon-Jones et al. (2013  ###reference_b14###). It determines the affective quality referring to the intrinsic pleasantness or unpleasantness of a stimulus (e.g., joy vs. toothache) Osgood et al. (1957  ###reference_b26###); Frijda (1986  ###reference_b10###). We hypothesize that PNCs with a higher or lower valence relative to their respective full name bear an evaluative character. To assess valence at the context level, we develop a computational approach. Since PNC meaning is heavily dependent on modifier meaning, we also examine to which extent modifier valence influences the evaluation of the whole compound. Lastly, we explore whether personal background information such as age, domain-specific knowledge and extra-linguistics information impact the PNC evaluation. To explore which factors are influential at a statistically significant level, we fit a range of regression models. Our results show that PNCs are both positively and negatively evaluative in comparison to their full name with a tendency towards a negative evaluative nature, underlining previous findings from Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###); Belosevic (2022  ###reference_b3###). We find domain-specific differences with public figures from the domain politics bearing a more negative meaning, while the opposite is true for PNCs from the domain sports and show business. Modeling modifiers reveals corresponding valence scores to be more extreme than valence scores obtained for the compound as a whole with a tendency towards lower valence. Our findings also highlight cases where modifier meaning is either interpreted non-literally or smoothed down when evaluated as a PNC constituent. Finally, while personal and domain-specific information impact the evaluative nature of a PNC, regression models including extra-linguistic information such as compound valence are more informative. Our best model thus combines information from all variables except name valence, with factors such as compound valence, domain, and political party membership playing an important role."

            "text": "PNCs such as Tore-Klose (‘Goal-Klose’) are nominal compounds that consist of a modifier which is usually realized in form of appellative or onymic constituents (e.g., Tore) and a head constituent that is filled with a first, last, or nick name (Klose) Belosevic (2022  ###reference_b3###).\nPNCs are formed based on regular patterns within a context that both evaluates and evokes knowledge regarding the name bearer Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###). For example, the PNC Tore-Klose (’Goal Klose’) refers to the former German soccer player Miroslav Klose who is the all-time top scorer for Germany with 16 goals scored during the Men’s FIFA World Cup. The example also illustrates the importance of the compound modifier contributing information regarding the name bearer or events in which the name bearer was involved. In other words, the meaning of the modifier is the reason or at least related to the reason why this compound was formed. In our example, goal hints towards a positive evaluation of the PNC as such an event is usually connected with particular athletic performance and special occasions, as well as concrete events such as scored goals during the soccer world cup in 2014."

            "text": "German PNCs are under-investigated from both a theoretical and computational point of view. Early work is limited to very small scale studies based on a few names Wildgen (1981  ###reference_b36###) or focus on other phenomena and touch on this composition type only in passing Kürschner (2020  ###reference_b19###); Ortner and Ortner (1984  ###reference_b24###); Ortner and Müller-Bollhagen (1991  ###reference_b25###); Schlücker (2017  ###reference_b30###, 2020  ###reference_b31###). An exception is recent work by Belosevic and Arndt-Lappe (2021  ###reference_b4###) who present a systematic analysis of ~1.2K PNCs to test three hypotheses on personal name composition that prevail in word formation (irregularity or unpredictability, low frequency, evaluative function). They compile a small Twitter and newspaper corpus, manually infer a paraphrase of the PNC in form of a relative clause, and assign a corresponding German FrameNet  ###reference_gsw.phil.hhu.de/### Ziem (2014  ###reference_b39###) relation. Their corpus analysis shows that not only are PNCs formed based on regular patterns but also bear an evaluative and a knowledge-evoking function.\nWhile this analysis constitutes an important contribution to name-based composition and evaluation, it is, however, limited by size and a manual approach.\nFrom a NLP perspective, PNCs have not received much attention yet. Related tasks such as noun compound interpretation where a noun compound is classified into a predefined label or expressed in a paraphrase Lauer (1995  ###reference_b20###); Kim and Baldwin (2005  ###reference_b16###); Shwartz and Dagan (2018  ###reference_b34###); Coil and Shwartz (2023  ###reference_b6###) and noun compound conceptualization exploring rare or novel interpretation through paraphrasing Dhar et al. (2019  ###reference_b7###); Li et al. (2022  ###reference_b21###) neither include PNCs nor approaches to assess the evaluative function of such compounds.\nAnother relevant line of work concentrates on sentiment analysis (SA), i.e., predicting the sentiment, attitude or opinion of text or speech on different units using e.g., the categories positive, neutral and negative Mohammad (2012  ###reference_b23###).\nWillkommens-Merkel\n(‘Welcome-Merkel’)\n#Lanz This political constellation should never have come about in the first place, says Merz.

We address this gap by developing two computational approaches drawing on valence norms and PLMs fine-tuned for SA to examine the evaluative nature of PNCs at discourse level."

We hypothesize that PNCs with higher or lower valence relative to their respective full name bear an evaluative character. For this, PNC and full name valence are assessed and compared at context level both cross and within domains. We further determine PNC modifier valence and explore the relationship between PNC and modifier evaluation. \n\nWe apply part-of-speech (PoS) tagging including lemmatization to all context words of a given target. We only keep context lemmas which belong to the word classes noun, adjective, or verb. \n\nOur findings are visualized including PNC frequency illustrated by increasing dot size. PNCs are sorted by name valence with the lowest valence score determined for the German businessman, arms dealer, and lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber, and the highest valence score calculated for the former German soccer player Bastian Schweinsteiger. We note that PNC valence moves more towards the name valence line in case of higher frequencies, while outlier PNC scores tend to be more distanced. Across domains, we find PNCs bearing a slightly more negative nature than full names with PNC valence distributed over a greater score range. More specifically, 56% of PNCs are shown to be more negatively evaluative than the corresponding full names.\n\nTo gain qualitative insights, we inspect the sample name-PNC pairs with the largest positive and negative relative differences and examine the most frequent context words. The greatest positive comes from the PNC Tore-Klose (‘Goal-Klose’) which refers to the former German soccer player Miroslav Klose. While name valence is around average, the PNC is evaluated very positively. Frequent context words of both PNC and name are on average positive since Klose was a very successful athlete, known for his fair play, and well-received in the public sphere. However, considering that the PNC Tore-Klose refers to the specific positive event of scoring many goals, the PNC is evaluated even more positively, with frequent context words such as feiern (‘celebrate’), herrlich (‘wonderful’), and gold (‘gold’) pointing at this finding.\n\nWhen looking at the pair with the greatest negative difference, we find the PNC Knast-Hoeneß (‘Prison-Hoeneß’). While Ulrich Hoeneß is also a successful former German soccer player, he is now mainly known for the fact that he was found guilty of serious cases of tax evasion. However, frequent context words are mixed, including the modifier Knast (‘prison’), sagen (‘to say’), and Jahr (‘year’). An explanation for this might be that the public credits Hoeneß for accepting the guilty verdict without appeal.\n\nWe further compare results within domains. As shown, PNC valence scores extend both below and above name valence for the domains politics and sports, while exceeding name valence only for others. Both PNC and name valence scores are lowest for public figures from politics, followed by the slightly more positively evaluated domain others. Athletes, in contrast, are generally evaluated more positively, surpassing the mean value of 5 for both PNC and name valence.\n\nWe find modifier valence to be spread across a substantially wider range than PNC valence. In comparison, PNC valence values range, with average PNC valence and average modifier valence. The majority of modifiers is located below PNC valence with modifier valence increasing only slightly with higher PNC valence.\n\nFor more fine-grained insights, we examine the modifier-PNC pairs with the largest positive and negative difference. Investigating the largest positive leads us to the PNC Willkommens-Merkel (‘Welcome-Merkel’). Inspecting frequent context words such as Abschiebung (‘deportation’), verheerend (‘devastating’), and Kritik (‘criticism’) reveals quite negative discourses. This might indicate potentially ironic use of the modifier welcome as the context words convey the opposite meaning or a negative stance towards corresponding political actions of the name bearer.\n\nThe modifier-PNC pair Enteignungs-Kühnert (‘Expropriation-Kühnert’) is the PNC with the largest negative. Here, modifier valence is extremely low, while PNC valence is around average. Context words are very mixed w.r.t. valence, including mentions of Partei (‘political party’), Wahl (‘election’), and Wohnung (‘apartment’). Thus, the extreme value of the modifier is not reflected by the context words and, consequently, PNC valence."

Our hypothesis is that PNCs with more positive or negative sentiment compared to their full names indicate an evaluative character. We frame this as a text classification problem, analyzing the context of PNCs or names to obtain predictions that are mapped onto a valence scale. This allows us to determine evaluative differences between PNCs and full names.\n\nWe utilize the model GBERT-Migration, which is a fine-tuned version of a sentiment analysis model for German, focusing on news articles about migration. Sentiment classification labels include negative, neutral, and positive, and computations derive a weighted valence score for each target. This score is based on the distribution of sentiment labels, weighing positive differently from neutral to account for nuanced evaluative meanings.\n\nOur findings indicate that PNCs often carry a more negative evaluative function than full names. However, comprehensive results suggest variability in predictions, with human evaluations generally indicating a more substantial negative interpretation of PNCs than computational approaches.\n\nWe conducted a human evaluation, testing 30 PNCs, and found instances where annotators’ perceptions diverged from computational predictions. Annotators expressed difficulty in labeling sentiment accurately, a factor that reflects the complexity of the task. Human annotations suggest a consistent pattern: PNCs within domains like sports are evaluated more positively than those in politics.\n\nThese findings emphasize that although PLM-based sentiment predictions can estimate whether PNCs are more evaluative than full names, human evaluations often reveal different nuances. Further investigation could focus on specific target sentiment prediction and enhancing model comprehension of overarching discourses. This would help refine the application of PLMs to sentiment analysis in a way that aligns more closely with human interpretation."

In a next step, we fit a range of linear regression models to see which relationships are directed and explore options for variable selection.\n\nFor each target, we manually collect and assign relevant personal background information based on publicly accessible information. We further model the relationship between the modifier and the compound head as frame elements of the event frame in which the name bearer participated, using German FrameNet:\n\nDomain (politics: 87%, sports: 9%, show business: 1%, others: 3%)  \nCurrent age in full years (if deceased: age at time of death)  \nCurrent nationality (Argentina, Austria, France, Turkey: <1%, Germany: 88% Russia, Sweden, UK: 1%, US: 7%)  \nPlace of birth (for feasibility restricted to West Germany: 77%, East Germany: 16%, outside of Germany: 7%)  \nGender (female: 22%, male: 78%)  \nPolitical party membership (Austria: Team HC Strache: <1%, Germany: AfD: 5%, CDU/CSU: 25/10%, FDP: 12%, The Greens: 12%, The Left: 1%, SPD: 18%, Centre: <1%; Russia: United Russia: 1%; UK: Conservatives: <1%; USA: Democrats: 3%, Republicans: 2%; non-party politicians are assigned the label independent; people who are neither politicians nor party members are assigned no party)  \nParticipation in events (20 German FrameNet frames; PNCs not representing an event corresponding to a frame or an unknown event are labeled not eventive or unknown, respectively)  \n\nTo further verify which predictors are relevant, we fit a linear regression model using elastic net regularization leveraging all variables. In general, the fitted model only explains a limited amount of variance.  \n\nAs a next step, we fit a range of multivariate regression models based on theoretical background, including models based on (i) personal information including age, gender or age, gender, nationality, origin, (ii) and domain-specific information such as domain and political party membership, as well as (iii) semantic knowledge and extra-linguistic information regarding the PNC.  \n\nResults reveal that only models based on (i) personal, or (ii) domain-specific information are significant but cannot explain the variance in the data very well. Models based on (iii) extra-linguistic information regarding the compound, on the other hand, are more successful.\n\nOverall, we observe a highly significant positive relationship for PNCs.  \n\nInterestingly, we find the domain sports connected to a slightly inverse relationship with top valence scores for athlete’s names and not the PNC. If a person identifies as male or comes from the U.S., the PNC is slightly more likely to be more positively or negatively evaluative, respectively. Political party membership has an inverse relationship in cases of the CDU, CSU, FDP, The Greens, and the SPD, while Democrats and Republicans come with a positive relationship (reference level: AfD)."

In particular, members of The Greens party are likely to be assigned a positive . Moreover, different birth places might be connected to differences in the evaluative nature of a corresponding PNC.\n\nTo further verify which predictors are relevant, we fit a linear regression model using elastic net regularization leveraging all variables excluding either name valence or PNC valence or both variables. Further details are reported in App. B.2  ###reference_###  ###reference_###. Excluding name valence places maximum importance on PNC valence as well as domain categories followed by personal information.

An example is the PNC Gold-Rosi (‘Gold-Rosi’) where top valence scores are related to the full name Rosi Mittermaier and PNC valence scores placed slightly below.

We examined 321 German PNCs from domains such as politics and sports and their respective full names, e.g., Angela Merkel. We developed two computational approaches based on PLMs and compared results to human annotation, uncovering domain-specific differences where athletes are generally evaluated more positively than politicians. To explore PNC connections to the respective real-world persons, we enriched our data with personal background information and employed regression analyses to demonstrate which factors influence PNC valence."
