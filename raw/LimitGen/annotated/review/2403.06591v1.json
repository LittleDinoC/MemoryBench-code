    "abstract": "The academic intelligence of large language models (LLMs) has made remarkable progress in recent times, but their social intelligence performance remains unclear.\nInspired by established human social intelligence frameworks, particularly Daniel Goleman’s social intelligence theory, we have developed a standardized social intelligence test based on real-world social scenarios to comprehensively assess the social intelligence of LLMs, termed as the Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI).\nWe conducted an extensive evaluation with 13 recent popular and state-of-art LLM agents on SESI.\nThe results indicate the social intelligence of LLMs still has significant room for improvement, with superficially friendliness as a primary reason for errors. Moreover, there exists a relatively low correlation between the social intelligence and academic intelligence exhibited by LLMs, suggesting that social intelligence is distinct from academic intelligence for LLMs. Additionally, while it is observed that LLMs can’t “understand” what social intelligence is, their social intelligence, similar to that of humans, is influenced by social factors.",

            "text": "The ability to understand and manage social relationships is one fundamental dimension of human intelligence, commonly denoted as social intelligence [1  ###reference_b1###]. Social intelligence enables humans to reduce conflicts and foster cooperation, thus navigating the social world. It not only correlates closely with individual success and life satisfaction [2  ###reference_b2###, 3  ###reference_b3###], but also is one of the most important ingredients in humans’ survival as a species in the long run [4  ###reference_b4###].\nAs a core component of human intelligence, social intelligence stands as an indispensable milestone on the path to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) [5  ###reference_b5###].\nOn one hand, social intelligence is necessary for effective interaction between intelligent agents and humans [6  ###reference_b6###], with its significance becoming increasingly pronounced as AI technology continues to advance [7  ###reference_b7###] and intelligent agents find increasing applications in our daily lives.\nFor example, the envisioned scenarios for intelligent systems in the ”real world,” such as welfare robots, household robots, and robots collaborating to solve common problems, heavily rely on effective communication and collaboration among artifacts as well as between artifacts and humans. This is particularly evident in cases where intelligent systems are expected to support humans in tasks involving numerous social interactions, such as serving as home tutors.\nOn the other hand, social intelligence provides the foundation for artificial intelligence systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to deeply learn, as language is inherently social, and meaning is constructed through social interactions [8  ###reference_b8###].\nMoreover, social intelligence is closely associated with crucial issues of AI alignment and governance.\nIndividuals with high social intelligence can effectively manage conflicts between individual and group objectives [9  ###reference_b9###], which is precisely the essence of most social alignment issues. Individuals with high social intelligence can also avoid toxic behaviors that make others feel diminished, incompetent, intimidated, angry, frustrated, or guilty, by equipping awareness of the impact on others [4  ###reference_b4###].\nTherefore, by strengthening research on social intelligence, we can better guide artificial intelligence towards a more intelligent and social direction, realizing a future of mutually beneficial human-machine collaboration.\nWhile the importance of social intelligence is widely acknowledged [10  ###reference_b10###], evaluating it within recently developed advanced AI systems, particularly large language models such as ChatGPT [11  ###reference_b11###, 12  ###reference_b12###], Claude [13  ###reference_b13###], and LLaMA [14  ###reference_b14###, 15  ###reference_b15###], remains limited.\nThe current research predominantly focuses on the investigation of academic intelligence in LLMs, showcasing their high performance in social isolated tasks, such as logic, automated theorem proving, diagnostic reasoning and so on [16  ###reference_b16###, 17  ###reference_b17###]. In contrast, the social intelligence of LLMs, crucial for real-world applications, is often perceived as a ”side effect” and has not been comprehensively established in a robust manner.\nSome researchers assess the social intelligence of LLMs based on classic tests of human social intelligence, such as ToMi [18  ###reference_b18###], which tests whether models can distinguish their own and others’ cognitive states in scenarios of information asymmetry, and FauxPas [19  ###reference_b19###], which tests whether models can provide correct responses to questions involving faux pas situations. These well-established tests have a long history, making it likely that LLMs have been exposed to and trained on them, raising challenges in discerning whether models truly possess a generalizable understanding of social factors [20  ###reference_b20###].\nSome other researchers assesses social intelligence of LLMs in the context of social factor understanding, exemplified by datasets such as SocialIQA [21  ###reference_b21###], SocKET [22  ###reference_b22###] and SECEU [23  ###reference_b23###]. These datasets focus on assessment of social awareness, the ability to comprehend and track agents’ inner states, such as emotions, beliefs, motivations and so on, while ignoring social facility, the ability to act smoothly and efficiently in relationships, which is necessary to guarantee fruitful interactions.\nThere are also two innovative benchmarks, SOTOPIA [24  ###reference_b24###] and EmoBench [25  ###reference_b25###], involving the application of social factors. However, they either employ manually crafted social contexts and goals, introducing subtle differences from real-world interactive scenarios, or solely focus on a single social factor, thereby limiting the ability to comprehensively assess social intelligence.\nTherefore, there is a need for a dynamic and comprehensive benchmark to go beyond existing benchmarks, in order to fully assess the social intelligence of LLMs.\n###figure_1### To fill the gap, we first propose a social intelligence framework to comprehensively describe and evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs, which is inspired by established human social intelligence frameworks, including the S.P.A.C.E theory [4  ###reference_b4###] and Daniel Goleman’s social intelligence theory [26  ###reference_b26###]. The social intelligence framework posits that the social intelligence of LLMs comprises two categories: social awareness and social facility, further delineated into five subcategories, as shown in Figure 1  ###reference_###.\nFollowing this, we developed the Situational Evaluation of Social Intelligence (SESI), which serves as a comprehensive, challenging benchmark for assessing the social intelligence of LLMs in real and complex social situations. For each sub-capacity of social intelligence mentioned earlier, the benchmark offers 100 corresponding questions as test items. Specifically, the social scenarios in the benchmark are derived from authentic requests for assistance posted by users on Reddit, with the correct answers determined based on the consensus of the top five most endorsed responses. This approach ensures the incorporation of genuine, complex social situations and allows for flexible and diverse solutions.\nCompared to the previously mentioned benchmarks, SESI possesses two distinctive advantages: 1) comprehensive, as our benchmark is grounded in established social intelligence theoretical framework, comprehensively assessing all the abilities encompassed by social intelligence; 2) dynamic, as test questions in our benchmark can be automatically generated based on Reddit Q&A posts. This allows for automatic updates over time, representing a core distinction from previous evaluations conducted on static datasets.\nWe then conducted an evaluation of a spectrum of mainstream and widely-adopted LLMs on SESI, and obtained the following findings:\n1) The social intelligence of LLMs still has significant room for improvement, as evidenced by the best-performing model, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, which achieves only 55.2% performance.\n2) The social intelligence of LLMs is distinct from academic intelligence, warranting investigation as a separate form of intelligence.\n3) LLMs are superficially friendly, following fixed friendly patterns without grounding them in real social situations, which is the main reason for the errors made by LLMs in social judgments.\n4) LLMs can’t “understand” what social intelligence means, as evidenced by their inconsistent social intelligence level with prompts.\n5) Social intelligence of LLMs, similar to that of human beings, is influenced by social factors, including personality, gender, social role and person."

            "text": "###figure_2### ###figure_3### We first assessed the overall impact of the five aforementioned factors on the social intelligence performance of LLM agents, as shown in Figure 3  ###reference_###. The significance of the impact of factors on model social intelligence is model-dependent. In comparison to the control prompt (no factor), the factors of person, emotion, role, and gender exhibit a more universal and significant impact () on the model’s social intelligence.\n###figure_4### Numerous studies have explored the relationship between personality and social intelligence, with a commonly observed trend associating extraversion with higher social intelligence [31  ###reference_b31###, 32  ###reference_b32###, 33  ###reference_b33###, 34  ###reference_b34###, 35  ###reference_b35###]. This pattern is also evident in LLM agents. Upon assigning personalities to LLM agents, it was observed that extraverted LLM agents consistently demonstrated higher levels of social intelligence across all models (see the first subfigure in Figure 4  ###reference_### (a)).\nContrary to human perceptions, agreeableness, typically associated with higher social intelligence in humans, displays a distinct trend in LLM agents. In this context, low agreeableness pushes the social intelligence of three models (text-davinci-002, llama-2-70b-chat and mixtral-8x7b-instruct) to the top rank, surpassing those with all other personalities and even those without personality (see Extended Data Table 2  ###reference_###). Besides, notably, all LLM agents with low agreeableness consistently demonstrate higher social intelligence compared to their counterparts with high agreeableness (see the second subfigure in Figure 4  ###reference_### (a)). We hypothesize that the reason for this lies in the fortuitous neutralization of the model’s superficially friendly tendency by the low agreeableness personality trait.\nDaniel Goleman’s theory of social intelligence also highlights the impact of human gender on social intelligence, suggesting that, on average, females tend to outperform males, particularly in the realm of empathy [26  ###reference_b26###]. However, our findings reveal that LLM agents assigned male gender consistently demonstrate heightened levels of social intelligence in comparison to their counterparts assigned female gender (see in Figure 4  ###reference_### (b)). It is noteworthy that this conclusion holds true only when gender is explicitly assigned to LLM agents. If gender is implicitly implied to LLM agents through social roles, this conclusion no longer holds.\nNumerous studies suggest that human social intelligence is influenced by social roles, encompassing occupational and interpersonal roles [26  ###reference_b26###, 36  ###reference_b36###, 37  ###reference_b37###, 38  ###reference_b38###]. Our results indicate that social roles significantly impact the social intelligence of LLM agents in a manner consistent with stereotypes, as shown in the Figure 4  ###reference_### (c). For example, as for occupational roles, all LLM agents assigned saler role exhibit the highest social intelligence. As for interpersonal roles, LLM agents assigned family roles or work roles exhibit the highest social intelligence. Conversely, romantic roles tend to diminish the social intelligence performance of LLM agents, primarily reducing influence — the capacity to make judicious choices to shape desired social outcomes.\nFurthermore, we observe that the overall impact of roles on the social intelligence performance of LLM agents primarily depends on the base model. It is evident that, for the GPT series of models, the addition of roles generally results in a positive impact on the social intelligence of LLM agents. Conversely, for LLaMA-based models, including LLaMA-2 and Vicuna, the addition of roles tends to have more of a negative impact on the social intelligence of LLM agents.\nWe also investigate whether different methods of integrating social roles into prompts affect the social intelligence performance of LLM agents. As shown in Extended Data Figure 3  ###reference_###, a discernible pattern consistently emerges: establishing roles in alignment with the protagonist in the given social situation enhances the social intelligence of the LLM agents more effectively than directly specifying roles, unless the designated role is that of a “Boss”.\nThe cognitive model of social phobia by Clark and Wells [40  ###reference_b40###] elicits and supports the influence of perspectives on human social performance, suggesting the observer perspective tends to induce more social anxiety and elicit more negative social feedback [39  ###reference_b39###]. The perspective can be manifested in language through the use of pronouns. Our results also reveal a similar phenomenon in Figure 4  ###reference_### (d), wherein LLM agents utilizing the second person perspective exhibit higher social performance compared to those using the third person perspective."

This issue holds significant implications for the training and application of LLM agents, yet it remains unexplored in current literature.\nTo verify the independence of social intelligence in LLM agents, we evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on both representative benchmarks for academic intelligence and the SESI benchmark, as shown in Table 1  ###reference_###. The performance of 13 popular and state-of-the-art LLM agents on five dimensions of academic intelligence was correlated with their SESI scores. As illustrated in Extend Data Table 1  ###reference_### and Figure 2  ###reference_###, the pearson correlation coefficient between SESI score and academic intelligence is significantly lower than that between academic intelligence alone. This correlation pattern lends support to the hypothesis that social intelligence is a distinct construct from academic intelligence, thus warranting increased attention and independent investigation."

These cases were then categorized to figure out the critical issues to resolve, as shown in Extended Data Figure 1  ###reference_###.\nOur analysis revealed that the primary wrong causes include superficially friendly, sidestepping question, and excessively general, with superficially friendly being the predominant factor for most models. In wrong cases caused by superficially friendly, LLMs tend to provide explanations or take actions following fixed friendly patterns, lacking the incorporation of specific social contexts for optimal social judgments. For instance, when faced with harm from others, LLMs consistently opted for tolerance without adjusting their responses based on the severity of the harm. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may be attributed to alignment techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), which tends to drive models towards general objectives, such as helpful, honest, and harmless, potentially overlooking subtle distinctions in behavior within complex social contexts."

To investigate this, we engaged in a systematic examination to observe whether LLM agents can understand prompts pertaining to varying levels of social intelligence.\nThe results consistently substantiate our hypothesis, as shown in Extended Data Figure 2  ###reference_###.\nSurprisingly, all LLM agents prompted to exhibit high levels of social intelligence paradoxically demonstrated lower social intelligence in real social judgments, especially in the realms of empathy and concern. This suggests a potential misalignment between the understanding of social intelligence by LLM agents and the actual manifestation of social intelligence.\nWe hypothesize that this is due to the fact that prompts with higher levels of social intelligence tend to drive the model towards the superficially friendly direction mentioned in Section 2.2  ###reference_###, thereby making it easier to overlook details in real social judgments."

            "text": "Correct answers were generated based on the most widely accepted responses under each post. Since each selected post has garnered attention from at least several hundred or even thousands of individuals, we posit that the top five responses beneath each post, acknowledged by such a substantial audience, can be considered as representative of the optimal answers within the current societal norms. Specifically, we opted for the top five responses under each post and, utilizing the GPT-3.5-turbo model based on the prompt in Extended Data Figure 5  ###reference_###  ###reference_###  ###reference_###, generated the correct answers to the questions. The selection of the correct answer is based on the principle of group consensus scoring, wherein individuals whose opinions align with the majority receive higher scores [28  ###reference_b28###  ###reference_b28###  ###reference_b28###]. This method represents one of the most prominent and widely discussed scoring procedures employed in social intelligence testing [41  ###reference_b41###  ###reference_b41###  ###reference_b41###].\nIn addition to correct answers, we collect two groups of wrong answers, including question-switching answers and reversed answers.\nQuestion-Switching Answers were generated by switching the questions asked about the context, as shown in Extended Data Figure 6  ###reference_###  ###reference_###  ###reference_###. As outlined in 3.2  ###reference_###  ###reference_###  ###reference_###, we categorize the measurement of social intelligence into 5 corresponding abilities, with the associated questions being: “Why does the person feel or act this way?”, “Is it normal for the person to act this way?”, “How to convey the person’s intentions efficiently and accurately?”, “How to shape the person’s desired social outcomes?”, “How to help the person?”.\nReversed Answers were answers that diverge from the standpoint of correct answers but remain rational. In this paper, we generated reversed answers by GPT-3.5-turbo. These answers can introduce greater diversity in the understanding and approaches toward societal issues within the generated answers, all while upholding a foundation of logical coherence.\nBy including answers about the same context, we ensure that these adversarial responses have the stylistic qualities of correct answers and strongly relate to the context topic, while still being incorrect, making it difficult for models to simply perform pattern-matching. To verify this, we compare valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) levels across answer types, computed using the VAD lexicon by [42  ###reference_b42###  ###reference_b42###  ###reference_b42###]. Both answer types differ slightly with correct answers ()."

For each context-question pair, three incorrect answers that are least entailed by the correct one are selected, following inspiration from [43  ###reference_b43###]. A context-question pair, these wrong options, combined with a correct answer, formed a complete test question.\nAfter the completion of the test formulation, each test item underwent validation by domain experts. Questions that did not align with correct social abilities, lacked a correct answer, or had non-unique correct answers were systematically eliminated."

The social situations in SESI exhibit remarkable length, complexity, and diversity. As depicted in Figure 5  ###reference_### (a), the average length of social contexts in the benchmark is 44.2 words, which is three times that of the common-sense reasoning dataset Social IQA [21  ###reference_b21###]. Figure 5  ###reference_### (c) indicates that 50% of the social situations in SESI involve three or more active characters, signifying the complexity of social scenarios. Additionally, as demonstrated in Figure 5  ###reference_### (e), SESI encompasses a diverse set of social relationship types. The distribution of social context length, character numbers, and relationship types underscores the challenging nature of the benchmark.\nComprehensive and balanced assessment of social intelligence abilities. Illustrated in Figure 5  ###reference_### (d), SESI provides a comprehensive and thorough evaluation across various dimensions of social intelligence. This evaluation extends beyond understanding social contexts (Empathy, Social-cognition) to changing social situations to achieve characters’ social goals (Self-presentation, Influence, Concern). This serves as a distinguishing factor between SESI and other common-sense reasoning benchmarks, which typically focus on measuring models’ social consciousness [21  ###reference_b21###, 44  ###reference_b44###].\nDetailed and specific answers. As presented in Figure 5  ###reference_### (b), the average answer length is 25.8 words, significantly surpassing other common-sense reasoning benchmarks where average answer lengths typically range between 3.6 to 10.5 words [21  ###reference_b21###, 44  ###reference_b44###]. This highlights the level of detail in the answer within SESI. Furthermore, it is observed that the length distributions of correct and incorrect answers are nearly the same, suggesting that the benchmark encourages models to focus on the substance of the responses rather than its length when making judgments."
