    "title": "Axolotl: Fairness through Assisted Self-Debiasing of Large Language Model Outputs",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing capabilities but are susceptible to biases present in their training data, leading to unfair outcomes in various applications. While numerous strategies have been proposed to mitigate bias, they often require extensive computational resources and may compromise model performance. In this work, we introduce Axolotl, a novel post-processing framework, which operates agnostically across tasks and models, leveraging public APIs to interact with LLMs without direct access to internal parameters. Through a three-step process resembling zero-shot learning, Axolotl identifies biases, proposes resolutions, and guides the model to self-debias its outputs. This approach minimizes computational costs and preserves model performance, making Axolotl a promising tool for debiasing LLM outputs with broad applicability and ease of use.",

            "text": "Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, offering unparalleled capabilities in understanding, generating, and translating text Zhu et al. (2023  ###reference_b34###); Zhang et al. (2020  ###reference_b30###). Despite their advancements, these models are not immune to inheriting and perpetuating biases present in their training data Maudslay et al. (2019a  ###reference_b17###). Often the uncurated datasets that these models are trained on reflect historical, societal, and cultural prejudices. Biases in LLMs can manifest in various forms such as gender, race, religion, profession, etc stereotypes, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in applications ranging from automated hiring systems to conversational AI Zhang et al. (2020  ###reference_b30###). Studies such as Bolukbasi et al. (2016b  ###reference_b6###) and Bender et al. (2021  ###reference_b4###) highlight the critical nature of this problem, demonstrating how biases can skew LLM outputs in ways that reinforce harmful stereotypes and marginalize already disadvantaged groups.\nResearchers have explored a multitude of strategies to identify and mitigate bias. These efforts encompass a broad spectrum of approaches, including enhancing fairness through modifications in sentence and word representations and embeddings May et al. (2019  ###reference_b19###); Caliskan et al. (2017b  ###reference_b9###); Ravfogel et al. (2020  ###reference_b25###), adjusting the underlying distribution of tokens Guo et al. (2022  ###reference_b14###), and refining datasets alongside model pre-training Garimella et al. (2021  ###reference_b13###); Maudslay et al. (2019a  ###reference_b17###, b  ###reference_b18###). While such interventions are crucial, they are not without their challenges. Specifically, the processes of pre-training or retraining LLMs entail significant computational resources and financial costs. Moreover, certain debiasing techniques may compromise the LLMs’ overall performance. Another notable issue is the reliance on access to the models’ internal configurations, a requirement that limits the applicability of these methods to open-source models and excludes the potential benefits of utilizing sophisticated, closed-source models. These factors underscore the need for innovative debiasing methodologies that are both cost-effective and performance-preserving.\nWe present Axolotl, a novel, model-agnostic and task-agnostic post-processing framework aimed at reducing bias through self-debiasing. Axolotl is inspired by the unique characteristics of the axolotl, a Mexican salamander known for its remarkable regenerative abilities. Just as the axolotl self-heals and regrow parts of its body, the Axolotl model is founded on self-debiasing by identifying and correcting biases in its outputs.\nInspired by zero-shot learning Radford et al. (2019  ###reference_b24###), Axolotl operates through a three-step process: first, it identifies bias (in form of an orientation to a demographic group and an unpleasant characteristic) within the model’s output; Second, it effectively proposes a resolution to counteract the detected bias, and the final step which involves guiding the model to revise and regenerate its previous response in light of this new, unbiased direction. This approach enables Axolotl to instruct the model on both the nature of the detected bias and the means for its rectification, thereby facilitating the self-debiasing of its initial response.\nMore importantly, Axolotl treats the Large Language Model (LLM) as a “black box”, leveraging public APIs to interact with the model without requiring direct access to the LLM’s parameters. This design choice significantly reduces the need for expensive computational resources, allowing our system to operate efficiently with minimal hardware requirements. By combining these elements, Axolotl stands out as a tool for mitigating bias in LLM outputs, ensuring broader applicability and ease of use across various platforms and models.\nIn summary, to the best of our knowledge, Axolotl is the first of it kinds with the following properties:\nAxolotl treats LLMs as black box, i.e., it does not require access to the internal model configurations.\nIt does not require pre-training or fine-tuning.\nAxolotl is model-agnostic and task-agnostic.\nIt can handle non-binary demographic groups and (multiple) sensitive attributes (including, but not limited to, race and profession).\n###figure_1###"

            "text": "The objective of our technique is to utilize embedding vectors to detect biased outputs generated by an LLM. At a high level, using a predefined list of cherry-picked words that can replace the potential problematic terms with more neutral or pleasant phrases we create an instruction for rewriting the sentence in a positive manner. We then rely on manual editing of the model's outputs by a human to remove bias without using any automated tools. Figure 1 ###reference_### shows the architecture of our system Axolotl. Given an input prompt, Axolotl uses a Model to generate a response output. The corresponding embedding vector of the output is denoted as. Consider a collection of vectors, representing the embedding vectors for the (demographic) groups (e.g., {male, female}), specified using the sensitive attributes (aka protected attributes) such as gender, race, and profession. We identify the bias in a model response as a pair of (a) an “orientation” towards a demographic group and (b) an “unpleasant characteristic” (Section 2.1 ###reference_###). The next step is identifying a “pleasant resolution” to rewrite the prompt and resolve the issue (Section 2.2 ###reference_###). Bias orientation specifies towards which demographic group bias exists. For example, let us consider the output “The CEO went to the tailor because he needed a suit” in Figure 1 ###reference_###. Using the vector representation of the output and the demographic groups, the bias orientation of this output is detected as male. Next, we need to identify if an unpleasant characteristic is associated with the bias orientation, and if so, to identify a pleasant resolution for it. For that purpose, for each group, we use the set of “unpleasant” and “pleasant” words111 Our research focuses on sentence-level analysis and the embeddings derived from sentences. The words are contextualized within basic sentence structures (e.g., ”This is kind”) to facilitate their representation. These constructed sentences and their corresponding embeddings form the basis of our computational framework. proposed by (May et al., 2019 ###reference_b19###). We refer to the sets of positive and negative words for each group as and. Looking back at Figure 1 ###reference_###, after detecting the bias orientation towards male, the unpleasant characteristic is detected as Manpower. Next, the pleasant resolution (the corresponding pleasant word) is detected as Equality. Finally, after the detection of bias (the orientation and the unpleasant characteristic) and the pleasant resolution, Axolotl use them to regenerate a new prompt to be passed to the (LLM) model (Section 2.3 ###reference_###)."

            "text": "As recommended by Dhamala et al. (2021a  ###reference_b11###), we use sentiment, toxicity, and regard as our evaluation metrics. Toxicity demonstrates the harmful or unpleasant content of the textual data. The toxicity classifier labels textual data using a numerical value between 0 and 100. The regard and sentiment classifiers produce outputs categorized as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\". It is crucial to distinguish between regard and sentiment. Regard precisely captures the sentiment toward a demographic group, while sentiment represents the overall sentiment of the sentence. Hence, regard serves as a measure of bias Sheng et al. (2019  ###reference_b27###) with a sentence marked as negative by the regard classifier indicating a tendency toward negative representation of a demographic group. This indicates the presence of harmful bias in the sentence. As our ultimate goal is to mitigate the harmful bias produced by the model, we prioritize reducing the proportion of the results generated by Axolotl labeled as negative by the regard classifier.\n###table_1### Table 6  ###reference_### presents the experiment results across four models and three sensitive attributes in BOLD. It is evident that following our method, negative regard has decreased in nearly all instances, with minimal changes observed in positive regard. Notably, for the gender attribute, this reduction is as substantial as half of the original regard score (0.028), in the results produced by Llama2-70B. This means that 50% of the textual data that was labeled as negative before rewrite, was detected positive by the regard classifier post-rewrite. This experiment verifies that Axolotl successfully achieved its goal with decreasing the harmful bias towards protected groups.\nIn contrast to the regard analysis, our attention here is directed towards the positive portion of the model-generated responses. As previously discussed, sentiment signifies the overall polarity of the sentence, indicating whether it leans towards positive or negative. Thus, a sentence labeled as positive conveys a positive message. Given that we have reduced harmful bias through the regard analysis, a higher percentage of positive sentiment suggests an improvement in the responses generated by Axolotl.\nTable 5  ###reference_### showcases the results obtained from the sentiment classifier across all models and sensitive attributes. There is a consistent trend across all models, indicating an increase in the percentage of positive labels alongside a decrease in the negative portion. Furthermore, our method proves effective in enhancing the performance of relatively smaller models such as llama2-13B and llama2-7B, sometimes surpassing or closely matching larger models. This improvement is particularly evident in the performance of llama2-13B. For instance, consider the results of all models on BOLD-profession. Prior to the rewrite, GPT-3.5 exhibited the highest percentage of positive sentiment, with llama2-13B ranking second. However, post-rewrite, llama2-13B generated more responses with positive sentiment than the other models.\nThe toxicity classifier evaluates content for unpleasant, harmful, or disrespectful elements and assigns a score between 0 and 100 to each sentence. Therefore, a decrease in toxicity indicates a superior performance of Axolotl. Table 3  ###reference_### displays the percentage reduction in toxicity for each model post-rewrite compared to the pre-rewrite version across various sensitive attributes. While reductions were observed across all models, llama2-13B exhibited the highest success rate in detecting and mitigating toxicity using our method. For instance, for the gender attribute, llama2-13B reduced toxicity by 31% post-rewrite. Overall, our results demonstrate that our method was particularly effective in identifying toxicity within BOLD-gender, with a maximum reduction of 31% in results generated by llama2-13B and 7% by GPT-3.5. However, it is important to note that since we are comparing the post-rewrite versions with the original texts generated by each model, the texts do not exhibit significantly high toxicity to begin with. That is due to the internal settings designed withing every model to prevent toxic behavior. This explains why the percentage improvements in many cases are relatively small."

We utilize the Stereoset dataset, developed by Nadeem et al. (2021  ###reference_b20###), specifically designed for multi-choice question answering. Stereoset contains two types of sentences for each sensitive attribute: Intersentences and Interasentences. For our task, we focus on Intersentences, where each data instance consists of a context sentence containing a target group and three corresponding sentences labeled as “stereotype”, “anti-stereotype”, and “meaningless”. The model is tasked with selecting the most suitable sentence matching the context. We follow the bias detection, pleasant resolution identification, and self-debiasing steps outlined in Section 2  ###reference_###.\nGiven the initial response  of the LLM model, the orientation to a group , the unpleasant characteristic (), and the pleasant resolution (),\nthe model is prompted to identify a better response from the three options provided. To evaluate the overall performance of Axolotl, we use the Stereotype Score (ss), which, according to Nadeem et al. (2021  ###reference_b20###), quantifies the ratio of stereotype to anti-stereotype association. A decrease in the ss score indicates a preference for anti-stereotype responses over stereotypical ones during the rewriting process. In an ideal scenario, a model with a ss score of 50 indicates a lack of preference for either stereotype or anti-stereotype scenarios. Our study focuses on mitigating stereotype/bias in the outputs generated by LMs. Therefore, we assess the effectiveness of Axolotl by measuring the reduction in ss after the rewrite.\nTable 4  ###reference_### presents the ss results across all models and sensitive attributes before and after the rewrite. Our experimental findings reveal a visible decrease in ss across all models and attributes, signifying an increase in anti-stereotype responses compared to stereotypical ones. In cases where the scores were already below 50, such as in the race attribute where  across models, the responses were already leaning towards anti-stereotypes, leaving minimal room for improvement by Axolotl. However, in instances where ss deviated significantly from 50, Axolotl successfully detected bias and provided effective guidance to reduce ss by promoting anti-stereotype associations. Specifically, for the profession attribute, the 10.1 drop in ss for GPT-3.5 and the 13.29 decrease for Llama2-70b, and the 8.16 decrease for Llama2-70b in gender attribute, illustrate the successful debiasing using Axolotl."

The WinoBias dataset, created by  Zhao et al. (2018  ###reference_b32###), is tailored to study gender bias within professions through co-reference resolution system. Each sentence in the dataset consists of two individual sentences, with the first mentioning one or two professions and the second containing one or two pronouns linked to those professions. In this task we leave one of the pronouns blank, and ask the model to select a suitable pronoun from three options: \"He/his\", \"She/her\", \"They/them\". Bias can manifest in this task when the model selects a pronoun that aligns with gender-based stereotypical scenarios.\nFor instance, the sentence \"[The lawyer] yelled at the hairdresser because [he] was mad.\" demonstrates a common stereotype linking \"lawyer\" with the male gender. To address such instances, we adopt the same procedure used in the Question Answering task. We provide the model with an instruction containing both  and , guiding it to produce a more appropriate response. One might argue that guiding the model to avoid gender-based stereotypical responses could inadvertently introduce bias in the opposite direction. However, our approach in co-reference resolution not only aims to circumvent stereotypical scenarios but also strives to generate gender-neutral responses.\nTable 3  ###reference_### presents the results on the WinoBias dataset across all four models.

Table 3  ###reference_###  ###reference_###  ###reference_### displays the percentage reduction in toxicity for each model post-rewrite compared to the pre-rewrite version across various sensitive attributes. While reductions were observed across all models, llama2-13B exhibited the highest success rate in detecting and mitigating toxicity using our method. For instance, for the gender attribute, llama2-13B reduced toxicity by 31% post-rewrite. Overall, our results demonstrate that our method was particularly effective in identifying toxicity within BOLD-gender, with a maximum reduction of 31% in results generated by llama2-13B and 7% by GPT-3.5. However, it is important to note that since we are comparing the post-rewrite versions with the original texts generated by each model, the texts do not exhibit significantly high toxicity to begin with. That is due to the internal settings designed withing every model to prevent toxic behavior. This explains why the percentage improvements in many cases are relatively small."

            "text": "Research into human-like bias in Large Language Models is an ongoing endeavor aimed at addressing bias-related challenges from multiple perspectives. Bias can infiltrate LLMs through various channels, including data annotation via crowdsourcing Otterbacher et al. (2018  ###reference_b21###); Buolamwini and Gebru (2018  ###reference_b7###); Bender and Friedman (2018  ###reference_b3###), dataset diversity across demographic groups Bolukbasi et al. (2016b  ###reference_b6###); Caliskan et al. (2017a  ###reference_b8###), and selecting models that amplify specific parts of the dataset, potentially overlooking certain demographic groups (e.g., models tailored for English-speaking users) Solaiman et al. (2019  ###reference_b28###); Hovy and Prabhumoye (2021  ###reference_b15###). These factors collectively contribute to reinforcing bias in language model performance.\nTo address bias, researchers have proposed various methods. Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) Maudslay et al. (2019a  ###reference_b17###) and data augmentation using demographic perturbation Qian et al. (2022  ###reference_b23###) aim to diminish bias within training datasets. A significant body of research is dedicated to addressing and mitigating existing bias at both the word-level Zhao et al. (2019  ###reference_b31###); Basta et al. (2019  ###reference_b2###); Dhamala et al. (2021b  ###reference_b12###); Ravfogel et al. (2020  ###reference_b25###) and sentence-level representations May et al. (2019  ###reference_b19###); Liu et al. (2019  ###reference_b16###); Cheng et al. (2021  ###reference_b10###).\nDespite this, studies have indicated that:\nBoth data augmentation and pre-training language models can be costly Garimella et al. (2021  ###reference_b13###).\nMany existing methods compromise the quality of the generated language model response Garimella et al. (2021  ###reference_b13###).\nSeveral existing methods are constrained to particular tasks Zheng et al. (2023  ###reference_b33###) or specific sensitive attributes Garimella et al. (2021  ###reference_b13###).\nNearly all current research relies on open-source models, necessitating access to the models’ internal configurations Schick et al. (2021  ###reference_b26###); Guo et al. (2022  ###reference_b14###).\nOur method is inspired by zero-shot learning techniques that leverage task descriptions Radford et al. (2019  ###reference_b24###).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the closest work to ours is by Schick et al. (2021  ###reference_b26###), which demonstrates that language models are cognizant of their biases and can self-diagnose by receiving a description of bias or stereotype. They then self-debias by reducing the probability of undesirable tokens, a process feasible only with open-source language models. Our method stands out as the first of its kind, as it does not require pre-training, fine-tuning, or accessing internal configurations (e.g., treating the model as a black box) for self-debiasing, while remaining task-agnostic."

            "text": "In this study, we introduced Axolotl, a novel post-processing framework designed to mitigate biases in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. By leveraging self-debiasing techniques, Axolotl operates as a task-agnostic and model-agnostic tool and addresses key challenges in bias mitigation without compromising computational efficiency or model performance. Through a three-step process resembling zero-shot learning, Axolotl effectively identifies and corrects biases in LLM outputs, ensuring fairer outcomes across various applications. By treating LLMs as “black boxes” and utilizing public APIs, Axolotl offers broader applicability and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for practitioners seeking to address bias in natural language processing systems. Future research can further explore the scalability and generalizability of Axolotl across different LLM architectures and applications, ultimately advancing the goal of creating more equitable and inclusive AI systems."

            "text": "In recognizing the limitations of our study, it is crucial to understand that the success of our approach closely depends on the effectiveness of embedding vectors Su et al. (2023  ###reference_b29###) and their ability to capture and reflect subtle semantic biases in language. The precision of text embedding models in identifying biases is critical; any inadequacy in this area could negatively impact the success of our proposed method.\nFurthermore, the integrity and selection of word sets  are crucial for the model’s success in identifying biases and suggestion viable resolutions. Inadequacies in these collections could impair the model’s ability to effectively address the bias.\nAlthough Axolotl introduces a robust mechanism for mitigating bias, it does not assure absolute eradication of bias. It serves as a post-processing technique that operates without altering the foundational parameters of the underlying model, thereby not addressing the model’s inherent biases directly.\nMoreover, the implementation of Axolotl as an online framework necessitates network access to interact with Language Models via public APIs. This requirement limits its application to scenarios where online connectivity is available or an in-house LLM is accessible."
