    "title": "Exploring Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Multi-Label Text Classification",
    "abstract": "Learning an effective representation in multi-label text classification (MLTC) is a significant challenge in NLP. This challenge arises from the inherent complexity of the task, which is shaped by two key factors: the intricate connections between labels and the widespread long-tailed distribution of the data. To overcome this issue, one potential approach involves integrating supervised contrastive learning with classical supervised loss functions. Although contrastive learning has shown remarkable performance in multi-class classification, its impact in the multi-label framework has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of supervised contrastive learning and its influence on representation in MLTC context. We emphasize the importance of considering long-tailed data distributions to build a robust representation space, which effectively addresses two critical challenges associated with contrastive learning that we identify: the \"lack of positives\" and the \"attraction-repulsion imbalance\". Building on this insight, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function for MLTC. It attains Micro-F1 scores that either match or surpass those obtained with other frequently employed loss functions, and demonstrates a significant improvement in Macro-F1 scores across three multi-label datasets.",

            "text": "In recent years, multi-label text classification has gained significant popularity in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Defined as the process of assigning one or more labels to a document, MLTC plays a crucial role in numerous real-world applications such as document classification, sentiment analysis, and news article categorization.\nDespite its similarity to multi-class mono-label text classification, MLTC presents two fundamental challenges: handling multiple labels per document and addressing datasets that tend to be long-tailed. These challenges highlight the inherent imbalance in real-world applications, where some labels are more present than others, making it hard to learn a robust semantic representation of documents.\nNumerous approaches have emerged to address this issue, such as incorporating label interactions in model construction and devising tailored loss functions. Some studies advocate expanding the representation space by incorporating statistical correlations through graph neural networks in the projection head Vu et al. (2022  ###reference_b21###); Xu et al. (2020  ###reference_b24###). Meanwhile, other approaches recommend either modifying the conventional Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) by assigning higher weights to certain samples and labels or introducing an auxiliary loss function for regularization Zhang et al. (2021  ###reference_b27###). Concurrently, recent approaches based on supervised contrastive learning employed as an auxiliary loss managed to enhance semantic representation in multi-class classification Cui et al. (2021  ###reference_b4###); Gunel et al. (2020  ###reference_b8###).\nWhile contrastive learning represents an interesting tool, its application in MLTC remains challenging due to several critical factors. Firstly, defining a positive pair of documents is difficult due to the interaction between labels. Indeed, documents can share some but not all labels, and it can be hard to clearly evaluate the degree of similarity required for a pair of documents to be considered positive. Secondly, the selection of effective data augmentation techniques necessary in contrastive learning proves to be a non-trivial task. Unlike images, where various geometric transformations are readily applicable, the discrete nature of text limits the creation of relevant augmentations. Finally, the data distribution in MLTC often shows an unbalanced or long-tailed pattern, with certain labels being noticeably more common than others. This might degrade the quality of the representation Graf et al. (2021  ###reference_b7###); Zhu et al. (2022  ###reference_b28###). Previous research in MLTC has utilized a hybrid loss, combining supervised contrastive learning with classical BCE, without exploring the effects and properties of contrastive learning on the representation space. Additionally, the inherent long-tailed distribution in the data remains unaddressed, leading to two significant challenges that we term as “lack of positive” and “attraction-repulsion imbalance”. The “lack of positive” issue arises when instances lack positive pairs in contrastive learning, and the “attraction-repulsion imbalance” is characterized by the dominance of attraction and repulsion terms for the labels in the head of the distribution.\nIn this paper, we address these challenges head-on and present a novel multi-label supervised contrastive approach, referred to as ABALONE, introducing the following key contributions:\nWe conduct a comprehensive examination of the influence of contrastive learning on the representation space, specifically in the absence of BCE and data augmentation.\nWe put forth a substantial ablation study, illustrating the crucial role of considering the long-tailed distribution of data in resolving challenges such as the “Attraction-repulsion imBAlance” and “Lack of pOsitive iNstancEs”.\nWe introduce a novel contrastive loss function for MLTC that attains Micro-F1 scores on par with or superior to existing loss functions, along with a marked enhancement in Macro-F1 scores.\nFinally, we examine the quality of the representation space and the transferability of the features learned through supervised contrastive learning.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: in Section 2  ###reference_###, we provide an overview of related work. Section 3  ###reference_### introduces the notations used throughout the paper and outlines our approach. In Section 4  ###reference_###, we present our experimental setup, while Section 5  ###reference_### provides results obtained from three datasets. Finally, Section 6  ###reference_### presents our conclusions."

            "text": "The idea of supervised contrastive learning has emerged in the domain of vision with the work of Khosla et al. (2020  ###reference_b11###) called SupCon. This study demonstrates how the application of a supervised contrastive loss may yield results in multi-class classification that are comparable, and in some cases even better, to the traditional approaches. The fundamental principle of contrastive learning involves enhancing the representation space by bringing an anchor and a positive sample closer in the embedding space, while simultaneously pushing negative samples away from the anchor. In supervised contrastive learning, a positive sample is characterized as an instance that shares identical class with the anchor. In Graf et al. (2021  ###reference_b7###), a comparison was made between the classical cross-entropy loss function and the SupCon loss. From this study, it appeared that both loss functions converge to the same representation under balanced settings and mild assumptions on the encoder. However, it was observed that the optimization behavior of SupCon enables better generalization compared to the cross-entropy loss.\nIn situations where there is a long-tailed distribution, it has been found that the representation learned via the contrastive loss might not be effective. One way to improve the representation space is by using class prototypes Zhu et al. (2022  ###reference_b28###); Cui et al. (2021  ###reference_b4###); Graf et al. (2021  ###reference_b7###). Although these methods have shown promising results, they primarily tackle challenges in multi-class classification problems."

            "text": "Learning MLTC using the binary cross-entropy loss function, while straightforward, continues to be a prevalent approach in the literature. A widely adopted and simple improvement to reduce imbalance in this setting is the use of focal loss Lin et al. (2017  ###reference_b14###). This approach prioritizes difficult examples by modifying the loss contribution of each sample, diminishing the loss for well-classified examples, and accentuating the importance of misclassified or hard-to-classify instances. An alternative strategy involved employing the asymmetric loss function Ridnik et al. (2021  ###reference_b18###), which tackles the imbalance between the positive and negative examples during training. This is achieved by assigning different penalty levels to false positive and false negative predictions. This approach enhances the model’s sensitivity to the class of interest, leading to improved performance, especially in datasets with imbalanced distributions.\nOther works combine an auxiliary loss function with BCE, as in multi-task learning, where an additional loss function serves as regularization. For instance, Zhang et al. (2021  ###reference_b27###) suggest incorporating an auxiliary loss function that specifically addresses whether two labels co-occur in the same document. Similarly, Alhuzali and Ananiadou (2021  ###reference_b1###) propose a label-correlation-aware loss function designed to maximize the separation between positive and negative labels inside an instance.\nRather than manipulating the loss function, alternative studies suggest adjusting the model architecture. A usual approach involves integrating statistical correlations between labels using Graph Neural Network Xu et al. (2020  ###reference_b24###); Ma et al. (2021  ###reference_b17###); Vu et al. (2022  ###reference_b21###). Additionally, a promising avenue of research looks into adding label parameters to the model, which would enable the learning of a unique representation for every label as opposed to a single global representation Kementchedjhieva and Chalkidis (2023  ###reference_b10###); Alhuzali and Ananiadou (2021  ###reference_b1###); Xiao et al.

            "text": "The use of supervised contrastive learning in multi-label classification has recently gained interest within the research community. All the existing studies investigate the effects of supervised contrastive learning by making some kind of prior assumption about label interactions in the learned representation space.\nDao et al. (2021  ###reference_b5###) suggest to use supervised contrastive learning for image classification based on the assumption that labels are situated in distinct areas of an image. Their contrastive loss is utilized alongside the BCE loss function and serves as a type of regularization more details can be found in Appendix F  ###reference_###.\nLin et al. (2023  ###reference_b13###) propose five different supervised contrastive loss functions that are used jointly with BCE to improve semantic representation of classes. In addition, Su et al. (2022  ###reference_b20###) suggest using a KNN algorithm during inference in order to improve performance. Some studies use supervised contrastive learning with a predefined hierarchy of labels Zhang et al. (2022  ###reference_b26###); Wang et al. (2022  ###reference_b22###).\nWhile contrastive loss functions in mono-label multi-class scenarios push apart representations of instances from different classes, directly applying this approach to the multi-label case may yield suboptimal representations, particularly for examples associated with multiple labels. This can lead to a deterioration in results, particularly in long-tail scenarios.\nIn contrast to other methods, our approach does not rely on any prior assumptions about label interactions. We address the long-tail distribution challenge in MLTC by proposing several key changes in the supervised contrastive learning loss."

A direct comparison between the baseline contrastive method , and our proposed  method (prior to fine-tuning) reveals a significant enhancement in both metrics score. The integration of fine-tuning using BCE significantly enhances  and  for both metrics, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Using our loss with fine-tuning is the only method able to surpass BCE in both metrics. This underscores its efficacy in creating well-differentiated and cohesive clusters in the latent space."

            "text": "In this paper, we have introduced a supervised contrastive learning loss for MLTC which outperforms standard BCE-based loss functions. Our method highlights the importance of considering the long-tailed distribution of data, addressing issues such as the ’lack of positives’ and the ’attraction-repulsion imbalance’. We have designed a loss that takes these issue into consideration, outperforming existing standard and contrastive losses in both micro-F1 and macro-F1 across three standard multi-label datasets. Moreover, we also verify that these considerations are also essential for creating an effective representation space. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that initializing the model’s learning with supervised contrastive pretraining yields better results than existing contrastive pre-training methods."

            "text": "Even though our approach demonstrates effectiveness in practice, it is subject to certain limitations, as outlined in this paper. \nFirstly, our approach inherits the typical drawbacks of contrastive learning, including a prolonged training phase relative to traditional methods and the necessity of a secondary step to evaluate the representation space with linear evaluation.\nSecondly, our experiments were solely conducted using the base version of the pre-trained model, without exploring the behaviors of supervised contrastive learning in larger versions of these models. \nLastly, investigating data augmentation for long texts presents challenges due to their discrete nature. We did not explore data augmentation techniques, despite the fact that they are critical in contrastive learning. Further research in this area could yield insightful contributions for future work."
