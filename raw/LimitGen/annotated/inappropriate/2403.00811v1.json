    "title": "Cognitive Bias in High-Stakes Decision-Making with LLMs",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential as tools to support an expanding range of decision-making tasks. However, given their training on human (created) data, LLMs can inherit both societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to cognitive bias. Such human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance.\nOur work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive sciences, we develop a dataset containing 16,800 prompts to evaluate different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, amidst proposing a novel method utilising LLMs to debias their own prompts.\nOur analysis provides a comprehensive picture on the presence and effects of cognitive bias across different commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our self-help debiasing effectively mitigate cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias type.",

            "text": "LLMs exhibit strong performance across multiple tasks Albrecht et al. (2022  ###reference_b2###), such as summarizing documents Wang et al. (2023  ###reference_b40###), answering math questions Imani et al. (2023  ###reference_b12###) or chat-support Lee et al. (2023  ###reference_b19###). These capabilities lead humans to increasingly use LLMs for support or advice in their day-to-day decisions Rastogi et al. (2023  ###reference_b27###); Li et al. (2022  ###reference_b20###). However, models suffer from various algorithmic bias, requiring procedures to evaluate and mitigate bias Zhao et al. (2018  ###reference_b45###); Nadeem et al. (2020  ###reference_b24###); Liang et al. (2021  ###reference_b21###); He et al. (2021  ###reference_b10###).\nIn addition to societal bias, LLMs can show human-like cognitive bias, which can implicitly mislead a user’s decision-making Schramowski et al. (2022  ###reference_b31###). Cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norms of rationality in judgment, where individuals (or LLMs) create their own “subjective reality” from their perception of the input  Haselton et al. (2015  ###reference_b9###); Kahneman et al. (1982  ###reference_b15###). Cognitive bias arises in human decision-making as well as human-ML interaction Bertrand et al. (2022  ###reference_b3###).\nWhen LLMs aid humans in high-stakes decision-making, such as evaluating individuals, it is of importance that these models are properly audited Rastogi et al. (2023  ###reference_b27###) so that decisions are not influenced by cognitive bias.\n###figure_1### Different from societal bias where behavior is influenced by social and cultural background, cognitive bias arises from the information processing mechanisms in the decision-making procedures, often influenced by the setup of the task. Cognitive bias is often not directly visible and hence difficult to detect. Multiple biases can interact in complex ways, complicating their identification and the assessment of their impact. The challenge of identifying and mitigating cognitive bias remains formidable due to the lack of assessment tools Sai et al. (2022  ###reference_b29###).\nTo tackle that, our work introduces a novel approach to quantify and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs using cognitive bias-aware prompting techniques.\nOur work proposes BiasBuster (Figure 1  ###reference_###), a systematic framework which encapsulates quantitative evaluation and automatic mitigation procedures for cognitive bias. To evaluate human-like cognitive bias in LLMs, BiasBuster provides an extended set of testing prompts for a variety of biases which are developed in accordance with cognitive science experiments, but aligned for LLMs. We develop metrics to measure cognitive bias in LLms when exposed to different “cognitively biased” and “neutral” prompts for the same task. BiasBuster compares different debiasing strategies, some shown to be effective on humans, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting. To minimize manual effort in prompt creation, we propose a novel prompting strategy where a language model debiases its own prompts and helps itself to be less subject to bias (we call it self-help ). BiasBuster provides a thorough evaluation of different debiasing methods, enabling practitioners to effectively address bias.\nTo avoid cross contamination with existing data that the model might have been trained on, BiasBuster provides novel prompts for a high-stakes decision-making scenario – student admission for a college program, where we generate and provide sets of cognitive bias testing and debiasing prompts. These testing prompts quantitatively evaluate various cognitive biases in terms of LLM self-consistency and decision confidence. The debiasing prompts assess the utility of various mitigation techniques, specifically focusing on the ability of LLMs to de-bias their own prompts."

(2022  ###reference_b37###). Previous work typically treats one bias at a time, which makes a generalized evaluation difficult. Viswanath and Zhang (2023  ###reference_b39###) propose a toolkit for evaluating social biases in LLMs, including evaluation metrics for detecting social biases, taking inspiration from Ribeiro et al. (2020  ###reference_b28###). Nozza et al. (2022  ###reference_b25###) discuss where to test for social biases in the LLM development pipeline. Ribeiro et al. (2020  ###reference_b28###) perform a test comprising a small set of neutral sentences with simple adjectives, label preserving perturbations to check if the behavior of the LLM differs, and a test adding a sentiment to the template to check if the model predicts the opposite sentiment Ribeiro et al. (2020  ###reference_b28###). Compared to their work, which focuses on the extent of biased decisions that are made towards protected groups, our work provides insight for human cognitive bias where we analyze flaws of language models during a decision-making procedure.\nExisting evaluation metrics for societal bias are often based on word embeddings Bolukbasi et al. (2016  ###reference_b4###); Papakyriakopoulos et al. (2020  ###reference_b26###); Viswanath and Zhang (2023  ###reference_b39###), making it not directly applicable for cognitive bias evaluation. Cognitive bias is not necessarily embedded in specific tokens, but might be reflected in the entire current Tversky and Kahneman (1981  ###reference_b36###) or previous context Echterhoff et al. (2022  ###reference_b5###)."

Jones and Steinhardt (2022  ###reference_b14###) test for systematic qualitative errors of LLM responses with human cognitive bias using coding prompts. Cognitive bias evaluation is also useful when benchmarking LLMs as evaluators, e.g. for data annotation Koo et al.

Inherent bias is instilled in the model, induced through the training data. Inherent bias is not necessarily obviously induced by the prompt, but by the general task itself. Sequential bias is induced by previous model answers.\nAnchoring\nImagine you are an admissions officer.

Compared to human participants, LLMs have the distinct advantage of being testable under various study conditions through repeated prompting.\nAnchoring bias describes the human tendency to change perception based on an anchor Kahneman et al. (1982  ###reference_b15###). In our work, we follow the setup of (Echterhoff et al., 2022  ###reference_b5###), in which decision-makers are influenced (anchored) by their own recent decisions. This setup aims to evaluate bias in sequential setups, compared to one-off prompt-based setups, which we discuss in the next section.\nTo analyse the influence of previous decisions in language models, we ask the model to take the role of an admissions officer deciding which student to admit to a college study program. We create synthetic student profiles, and show them to the language model in one conversation by always adding the previous student and the model’s previous decision to the context. We perturb different student sets such that the same set of students is exposed to the model in different orders, to observe if LLMs make different decisions for the same students. We show examples for our templates in Table 1  ###reference_###.\nWe want to measure the confidence of a model in its admission decision for each student over multiple perturbations of the order. As the model has some inherent admission rate , we have to evaluate a particular students admission rate  for all orders in accordance to . The idea is here that the model is very confident with a student decision, when the general admissions rate is low, but the student admissions rate over multiple order perturbations is high. It is not confident if . To measure this, we use the normalized euclidean distance of the admission-rejection probability distribution;\nwhere  and  for all instances in our student set.\nWe apply the concept of Euclidean distance to measure the dissimilarity between two probability distributions, where each distribution (selection, instance) is represented by a vector whose elements sum to 1. The maximum Euclidean distance between two 2-element vectors that sum to 1 is , so we normalize the numbers to get a ratio between 0 and 1, a small value indicating low confidence, and 1 high confidence. We subsequently average over all students.\nStatus quo bias is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency of people to prefer and choose the current state of affairs or the existing situation over change or alternative options Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988  ###reference_b30###). Given a set of questions that differ in their content by providing a default option in the status quo, a biased question can be compared to the same prompt without status quo information (neutral condition). Questions always provide different options to choose from.\nWe take inspiration from the original set of questions from Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988  ###reference_b30###) which bias the user with a status quo option with respect to car brands and investment options to choose from. Given e.g. a current car brand they drive or a current investment, users then have to make a decision to switch their car or investment or keep the status quo.\nWe develop a template for the status quo bias between a neutral question, which has no information on current status, and a status quo question for the student admission setup. In this case, we ask for a student to be admitted to someone’s lab given some student features, and provide 4 options to choose from. We define the status quo to be “having worked with student X in a summer internship before”. Other parts of question and the student options remain the same. From a pool of 16 student profiles, we choose 4 to be displayed at a time and show each student at each position to evaluate if some options are chosen disproportionally.\nIn the status quo experiment, we have a single-choice problem setup, where for each question we can select exactly one option. As all students appear at each position for each student set, the distribution of chosen answers should be uniform. We measure if any option (A,B,C,D) is chosen more often than others. A model would suffer from status quo bias if the default option is chosen more often than other options, so if  for the number of times the status quo option was chosen () over all decisions .\nFraming bias denotes the alteration in individuals’ responses when confronted with a problem presented in a different way Tversky and Kahneman (1981  ###reference_b36###). The original work shows that individuals choose different options, even when the options are the same, depending on how the questions are framed.\nWe take inspiration from the positive and negative framing for saving people Jones and Steinhardt (2022  ###reference_b14###), and adapt it to the context of college admission, specifically in scenarios where an officer reviews students’ profiles presented one at the same time. We ask the language model for their decision based on their profile. We prompt the model with both positive and negative framing for each student and asses if the model changes its behavior influenced by the framing. In the positive frame, we ask the model if it will admit the student; in the negative frame, we ask if it will reject the student.\nTo analyse the difference in admissions or rejection behavior, we observe the admissions rate  for admission decisions where  for rejection/admission of a student for all students , which should not be affected by the framing of the question.\nGroup attribution error refers to the inclination to broadly apply characteristics or behaviors to an entire group based on one’s overall impressions of that group. This involves making prejudiced assumptions about a minority group, leading to stereotyping Hamilton and Gifford (1976  ###reference_b8###).\nTo analyze group attribution bias in language models, we set the model in the role of an admissions officer. We select an attribute (gender), and a stereotypical characteristic associated with one of two groups (being good at math). We create synthetic data containing basic information about students. All student data, except for the group attribute gender, is kept identical. Our aim is to demonstrate that, with all other data being equal, an LLM might change its assessment of a person’s mathematical ability based on a change in gender.\nSimilar to framing bias, we can evaluate group attribution bias with the difference rate of classified instances as being good at math/not good at math for the different groups.\nPrimacy bias is a cognitive bias where individuals tend to give more weight or importance to information that they encounter first. This bias can lead to a skewed perception or decision-making process, often prioritizing the initial pieces of information over those that are presented later, regardless of their relevance or accuracy Glenberg et al. (1980  ###reference_b6###).\nWe use the neutral version of the task for status quo bias (without any status quo priming) to examine primacy bias, as the possible options are all shuffled such that for each student set sequence, each student is represented at each option (A,B,C,D). All prompt examples are shown in Table 1  ###reference_###.\nIn an unbiased case, this setup should lead to a uniform distribution of answer selections. However, if the model is biased, it might lead to an increased selection of answers that are presented early in the prompt. We hence assume the model to be biased if  for the ratio of early options chosen (A,B) over later options (C,D)."

            "text": "Mitigating cognitive bias presents two complex challenges. First, devising a specific example to illustrate a single cognitive bias is difficult, and it is impossible to create a generalized example that encompasses multiple biases due to their significant differences. Second, the introduction of new information can unintentionally lead to the emergence of alternative biases Teng (2013  ###reference_b35###), complicating the development of examples. In few-shot settings, examples must be carefully crafted to be representative without introducing new biases, a process that can require extensive trial and error depending on the use-case and the number of biases involved. Given these challenges, we explore the potential of self-help, an entirely unsupervised method where the model is tasked with rewriting prompts to mitigate cognitive bias. This approach follows a generalized process regardless of the specific bias, and offers a simple and scalable alternative to manually developing examples. We assess the effectiveness of generating de-biased prompts by instructing the model to re-answer the original question.\n“Rewrite the following prompt such that a reviewer would not be biased by cognitive bias.\n[start of prompt] … [end of prompt]\n\nStart your answer with [start of revised prompt]”\nThis method requires no manual adaptation. However, for each sample, an additional forward pass is necessary.\nFor self-help for anchoring bias, the prompts itself can not be “de-biased” (due to the bias being induced by previous decisions). Instead, we give the model the opportunity to de-bias its own decisions based on its last prompt in the sequential procedure, which lists all student profiles and previous decisions. We ask to it to change its decisions if there was a chance of bias."

            "text": "We evaluate four language models with different capabilities. We evaluate state of the art commercial language models such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4111For group attribution and framing in GPT-4, we limit the evaluation to 400 prompts per experiment to reduce cost. As these biases are not sentitive to order, we assume these results generalize to the full data., as well as open-source large language models such as LLama 2 in sizes 7B and 13B.\nWe observe cognitive bias for both framing bias as well as group attribution bias as shown in Table 3  ###reference_###, where we see that all models show different behavior for either admission/rejection framing or male/female group attribution. We see that GPT-4 is specifically vulnerable to framing bias where it admits 40% more students in the reject framing. LLama-2 7B is specifically vulnerable to group attribution bias where the model classifies 32% fewer females as being good at math.\nWe do not observe a clear indication of status quo bias that is similar to human bias. Rather, we observe that for all models except GPT-4, status-qup-biased prompts are inversely biasing the model. For example, when prompting the model for the current option being option A, A is selected fewer times compared to the neutral prompt. This is shown in Figure 3  ###reference_###.\n###figure_4### ###figure_5### ###figure_6### ###figure_7### We observe that models tend to have a preference for options that are shown early in the prompt ( e.g. A or B in single-choice setup) which we see in the distribution of option selection in Figure 3  ###reference_###, where the fraction of chosen options A or B exceeds the fraction of C plus D.\nIn anchoring bias, we observe the existence of smaller decision confidence in the original (random order) evaluation setup which might be attributed by the influence of previous decisions on next decisions and unawareness of bias (Figure 3  ###reference_###).\nWe see that self-help increases the decision confidence for commercial GPT models, but not for open-source Llama models (Figure 4  ###reference_###). When given the opportunity to the model to change its decisions when bias might be present, we see that Llama models tend to change between 40-52% of their decisions, which indicates a severe amount of inconsistency in decisions between the sequential setup and the self-help setup, where all information and decisions are seen at once. We hence conclude that self-help for anchoring can only be performed by high-capacity models, or that only high-capacity models should be used to debias these prompts for lower capacity models. For Llama models, the awareness debiasing mitigation strategy shows best results, as contrastive and counterfactual methods either lead to low confidence or the possibility for collapse (leading to only responding with “admit” e.g. for Llama-2-7b counterfactual) (Figure 4  ###reference_###).\nPrimacy bias is defined through the preference of selection for information that is first encountered. We observe in Table 3  ###reference_### that the fraction of initially seen answer options (a or b) is selected more frequently compared to later options (c or d). Cognitive bias awareness seems to mitigate the issue to a certain extent for LLama 2 and GPT-4, but self-help balances the answer distribution to the desired distribution for Llama 2 7B and GPT-4. Lower capacity models like GPT-3.5-turbo have less capacity to debias themselves, but compared to other approaches which can exhibit complete failure (e.g. counterfactual prompting), self-help still performs best.\nWhen looking at bias which is induced by the prompt, we analyse the behavior of self-help to remove the parts of the prompt that are associated with the cognitive bias condition. We see that self-help can reduce the number of biased prompts (e.g. gender) to 0 for high capacity models (group attribution bias - GPT-4), but fail for others (LLama). We see good debiasing performance of low capacity methods for framing bias (0% for Llama 2 13B and 1.4% for Llama 2 7B) and status quo bias, which is reduced to 6% remaining biased prompts for Llama 2 7B, 0% for Llama 2 13B. GPT-4 reduces group attribution bias elements to 0% and 2.7% for framing bias elements. GPT 3.5 shows small capabilities to reduce biased group attribution prompts (reduction by 8.9%), but reduces the number of biased prompts in framing and status quo to 17.2 % and 8.5%.\n###figure_8### Our findings indicate an advancement in the performance of higher capacity models using self-help debiasing. These models, equipped with enhanced computational capabilities and a larger parameter space, demonstrate a notable proficiency in autonomously rewriting their input prompts to mitigate cognitive biases compared to lower parameter models. We specifically observe this in the increased prompts without cognitive bias inducing words (Table 4  ###reference_###). High capacity models can reduce the bias in prompts to 0 for Group Attribution and Framing bias.\nSelf-help is an unrestricted format to de-bias input prompts. When rewriting the prompts, the model is naturally going to introduce some variation in wording. Small changes in prompts can act as significant confounding factors for LLMs Wang et al. (2022  ###reference_b41###); Tam et al. (2023  ###reference_b34###); Xiong et al. (2023  ###reference_b43###), leading to large variations in decisions and outputs. Hence even when removing a large fraction of biasing prompt components, we can still observe a delta in results."

            "text": "For different biases we see that few-shot prompting can lead to failure cases, e.g. driving the probability of admission/rejection to zero or one and hence undermining the ability to follow the instruction correctly for all biases, e.g. for status quo bias, anchoring bias, framing or group attribution bias (Table 3  ###reference_###), specifically for open-source LLMs.\nCounterfactual mitigation adds a large amount of additional context which can change the prompt drastically and hence lead to extreme results and loss of instruction following. Previous work also shows that there are inconsistencies in LLMs that lead to significantly different results for minor prompt deviations Wang et al. (2022  ###reference_b41###); Tam et al. (2023  ###reference_b34###); Xiong et al. (2023  ###reference_b43###). For cognitive bias mitigation, giving an example often needs a significant explanation of the setup that leads to the bias and it can be hard to find short examples that still explain the failure case properly, making it a weak spot for contrastive and counterfactual mitigation methods."

We provide a dataset to test for inherent, prompt-based and sequential cognitive bias. We evaluate different kinds of biases and mitigation procedures, and propose a self-debiasing technique that enables models to autonomously rewrite their own prompts. We observe de-biasing capabilities of this method for a variety of biases, proving successfur for the mitigation of various biases. Our method has the advantage of not requiring manually developed examples as de-biasing information to give to the model, and is applicable to a variety of biases. This self-regulatory mechanism marks a pivotal step towards creating more impartial and reliable AI tools. Our findings highlight the capabilities and limitations of models in terms of self-improvement but also pave the way for developing AI systems that are inherently more aware and capable of correcting their biases."

The intended use of this data is to advance and facilitate the mitigation of inconsistent decisions due to cognitive bias in LLMs for high-stakes decision-making.

We acknowledge that there may be other biases of interest that can be analyzed and we plan to expand the range of test biases\nin future iterations of BiasBuster. We like to note that due to computing constraints, we are unable to evaluate very large open-source language\nmodels such as Vicuna-60B or OPT-175B. This work however aims to encourage a protocol for consistent testing with cognitively biased data to facilitate consistent LLM decision-making. Additionally, our data can be used to test for LLM decision inconsistencies\nwith minimal changes in the prompts. We specifically discourage the misuse of this data to make models more cognitively biased.
