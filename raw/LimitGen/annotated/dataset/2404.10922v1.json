    "title": "Teaching a Multilingual Large Language Model to Understand Multilingual Speech via Multi-Instructional Training",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in language modeling have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of various natural language processing tasks. Despite their success in text-based tasks, applying LLMs to the speech domain remains limited and challenging. This paper presents BLOOMZMMS, a novel model that integrates a multilingual LLM with a multilingual speech encoder, aiming to harness the capabilities of LLMs for speech recognition and beyond. Utilizing a multi-instructional training approach, we demonstrate the transferability of linguistic knowledge from the text to the speech modality. Our experiments, conducted on 1900 hours of transcribed data from 139 languages, establish that a multilingual speech representation can be effectively learned and aligned with a multilingual LLM. While this learned representation initially shows limitations in task generalization, we address this issue by generating synthetic targets in a multi-instructional style. Our zero-shot evaluation results confirm the robustness of our approach across multiple tasks, including speech translation and multilingual spoken language understanding, thereby opening new avenues for applying LLMs in the speech domain.",

            "text": "Language modeling task involves predicting subsequent text tokens based on a context of preceding ones Jurafsky and Martin (2009). Training a language model (LM) requires only raw text samples, as portions of these samples function as their labels, facilitating a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach. The widespread availability of machine-readable text online, coupled with advancements in computational power, has led to the rise of large LMs (LLMs) in recent years. These LLMs not only generate highly fluent natural text but also encode higher-level knowledge within their parameters. This enables them to tackle natural language processing tasks like reading comprehension and machine translation based only on task specific instructions, without needing labeled data Radford et al. (2019).\n\nSSL has recently made significant strides in the speech domain Baevski et al. (2020). Most applications of SSL in speech employ an encoder that transforms raw speech signals into high-level representations, serving either as a fixed feature extractor Yang et al. (2021) or a tunable pretrained model for various downstream tasks Babu et al. (2021). Incorporating of SSL pretrained encoders into Encoder-Decoder speech recognition models has dramatically reduced the amount of labeled data required for effective training Chang et al. (2021). However, using SSL pretrained decoders in such models is relatively rare. In certain instances, SSL is part of a joint training process that seeks to learn a shared speech and text representation Chen et al. (2022). However, this approach often demands a large dataset and considerable computational resources.\n\nRecent work has begun to harness the powerful text generation capabilities of decoder-only LLMs by incorporating them as the decoder component of Encoder-Decoder speech processing models. Wu et al. (2023) adopt the LLaMA-7B LLM for speech translation to English by training a speech encoder from scratch using filter bank acoustic features, 14,000 hours of internal speech data in 14 languages, and outputs of internal translation system as synthetic targets. Outputs of speech encoder are aligned with the text token embedding space using CTC pretraining and downsampled by averaging of consecutive frames with the same CTC output label. Ling et al. (2023) adopt the GPT2 XL LLM for fully-formatted English speech recognition by training a speech encoder from scratch using filter bank acoustic features, and 75,000 hours of internal transcribed English speech data. CTC loss is applied to speech encoder outputs as a part of the main training process and speech representations are downsampled by removal of frames classified as CTC blank labels with a predefined threshold. Li et al. (2023) adopt the LLaMA-7B LLM for long-form English speech recognition by incorporating the HuBERT-Large SSL pretrained speech encoder and finetuning it on the LibriSpeech dataset containing 960 hours of transcribed English speech. Outputs of the speech encoder are downsampled by a convolutional module trained as a part of the main training process. Fathullah et al. (2023) adopt the LLaMA-7B LLM for speech recognition in 8 languages by training a speech encoder from scratch using filter bank acoustic features and the Multilingual LibriSpeech dataset containing 50,000 hours of transcribed speech in the same 8 languages. Speech encoder is pretrained with CTC loss and its outputs are downsampled by simple discarding of every frames. Nachmani et al. (2023) combine an internal pretrained LLM with an internal pretrained speech encoder and finetune it on the automatically transcribed LibriLight dataset containing 60,000 hours of English speech. The training is performed with a combination of the speech transcription and speech continuation tasks. The resulting model is utilized for the spoken language answering task.\n\nMost of these studies rely on conventional filter bank features for speech encoding and do not incorporate an SSL pretrained speech encoder, necessitating a large amount of training data. Moreover, scant attention has been given to leveraging the linguistic knowledge stored in LLMs for tasks beyond mere transcription and for languages other than English.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose BLOOMZMMS, a model that fuses a multilingual LLM (BLOOMZ Muennighoff et al. (2023)) with a multilingual speech encoder (MMS Pratap et al. (2023)). We argue that multi-instructional training is crucial for transferring linguistic knowledge from the text to speech modality. Our experiments demonstrate that training on 1900 hours of transcribed data from 139 languages yields a multilingual speech representation compatible with a multilingual LLM in the context of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task. Although this representation does not generalize well to other tasks, we show that the issue can be mitigated by generating additional synthetic targets. Our zero-shot evaluations confirm this approach’s effectiveness across various tasks, including Spoken Language Translation (SLT) and multilingual spoken Natural Language Inference"

The Convolutions to Gated MultiLayer Perceptron module has 8192 units and the convolution kernel size is 31. The Length Adaptor module contains a 1-dimensional convolutional layer with stride 2 and reduces the length of the input sequence by a factor of 2. Self-conditioning on language identity Chen et al.

The total number of parameters in our model is 8.6 billion, and the number of trainable parameters is 536 million. We apply 8-bit quantization Dettmers et al. (2022  ###reference_b10###) to the LLM using the functions from the bitsandbytes package version 0.41.1.\n\nThe training is done with the Adam optimizer Kingma and Ba (2015  ###reference_b15###) with the warmup learning rate scheduler with the maximum learning rate and a weight decay of . 3-way speed perturbation Ko et al. (2015  ###reference_b16###) data augmentation method is applied to the training data. The training stage one, CTC loss training, is performed on two NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs with a global batch size of 7.29 minutes. The number of warmup steps for the learning rate scheduler is set to 25,000. A checkpoint is saved every 23,364 steps and evaluated on the validation dataset. The training is stopped after four consecutive evaluations show no improvement; it takes 233,640 update steps or 120 hours of training time to reach this condition. A checkpoint with the lowest validation CER from stage one is used to initialize the model for stage two.\n\nThe training stage two, CE loss training, is performed on four NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs with a batch size of 37.50 seconds and a gradient accumulation over two batches. The number of warmup steps for the learning rate scheduler is set to 10,000. A checkpoint is saved every 54,381 steps and evaluated on the validation dataset. The training is stopped after four consecutive evaluations show no improvement. To reach this condition, it takes 652,572 update steps or 132 hours of training on the transcription targets, 2,664,669 update steps or 686 hours on the multi-instructional targets, and 2,501,526 update steps or 644 hours on the combined set of targets. A checkpoint with the highest validation token prediction accuracy from the second step is used for the zero-shot evaluations.\n\nWe decode with the beam search of size 5 and set the maximum output sequence to 192 tokens to obtain the model predictions for the ASR and SLT evaluations. The GLUE and NLI evaluations restrict the output to the possible answer options corresponding to a task and limit the beam size and maximum output sequence respectively. For example, for a yes/no question, the possible outputs are yes or no, the beam size is 2, and the maximum output sequence is 1. All evaluations are executed on one NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU."
