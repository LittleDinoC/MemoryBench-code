    "title": "Khayyam Challenge (PersianMMLU): Is Your LLM Truly Wise to The Persian Language?",
    "abstract": "Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to their generative nature, necessitating precise evaluation methodologies. Additionally, non-English LLM evaluation lags behind English, resulting in the absence or weakness of LLMs for many languages.\nIn response to this necessity, we introduce Khayyam Challenge (also known as PersianMMLU), a meticulously curated collection comprising 20,192 four-choice questions sourced from 38 diverse tasks extracted from Persian examinations, spanning a wide spectrum of subjects, complexities, and ages. The primary objective of the Khayyam Challenge is to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of LLMs that support the Persian language. Distinctive features of the Khayyam Challenge are (i) its comprehensive coverage of various topics, including literary comprehension, mathematics, sciences, logic, intelligence testing, etc aimed at assessing different facets of LLMs such as language comprehension, reasoning, and information retrieval across various educational stages, from lower primary school to upper secondary school (ii) its inclusion of rich metadata such as human response rates, difficulty levels, and descriptive answers (iii) its utilization of new data to avoid data contamination issues prevalent in existing frameworks (iv) its use of original, non-translated data tailored for Persian speakers, ensuring the framework is free from translation challenges and errors while encompassing cultural nuances (v) its inherent scalability for future data updates and evaluations without requiring special human effort. Previous works lacked an evaluation framework that combined all of these features into a single comprehensive benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate a wide range of existing LLMs that support the Persian language, with statistical analyses and interpretations of their outputs. We believe that the Khayyam Challenge will improve advancements in LLMs for the Persian language by highlighting the existing limitations of current models, while also enhancing the precision and depth of evaluations on LLMs, even within the English language context.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized applications of machine intelligence (Hong et al., 2024  ###reference_b11###; Wu et al., 2023  ###reference_b21###; Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023  ###reference_b19###; Glukhov et al., 2023  ###reference_b8###). The rapid deployment of these models within industrial and public sector solutions has made evaluating their capabilities an imperative task (Guo et al., 2023  ###reference_b9###).\nTo address critical aspects of language understanding and bridge the gap between the knowledge that models observed during pretraining and the measures of success, the MMLU benchmark was introduced (Hendrycks et al., 2021  ###reference_b10###). It assesses the ability of LLMs across a diverse set containing 57 subjects.\nAlthough automatic translation efforts like MMLU can bridge the gap in evaluation resources for languages other than English (Achiam et al., 2023  ###reference_b2###), the cultural specificity of these questions limits their applicability across different languages and cultures. This is particularly true for Persian, a language with its own rich culture and literature, where direct translation of English MMLU content may not be suitable for certain culture-specific subjects. In addition, our investigation reveals significant complications in automatic translation, particularly in specialized domains like Physics, which can be attributed to the quality of state-of-the-art translations for specific subjects. Despite advancements in machine translation technology, accurately conveying precise meaning in certain domains remains a hard task. For instance, the GPT-3.5 automatic translation often fails to include essential units such as\n”microjoules” in translations, leading to inaccuracies. Also, loss of information can occur in translation due to the existence of Persian words that lack exact equivalents in English. For example, in Persian, there are distinct terms for paternal aunt, maternal aunt, paternal uncle, and maternal uncle, while in English, only “aunt” and “uncle” are used (See Table 1  ###reference_###). This underscores the inherent difficulty in translating domain-specific terminology accurately. For such reasons, some studies have evaluated LLMs on original non-English datasets rather than the translated ones. For instance, Li et al. (2023  ###reference_b14###) has introduced a Chinese dataset across 67 topics and indicated that current models struggle to achieve accuracies above a certain threshold. Also, Zhang et al. (2023  ###reference_b22###) introduced a multilingual and multimodal dataset, and showed that multilingual text processing hardly achieves over  accuracy.\nMotivated by the mentioned issues, we propose the Khayyam Challenge, also referred to as PersianMMLU, a benchmark designed to analyze the performance of LLMs in Persian and evaluate their knowledge and abilities comprehensively.\nNamed in honor of the famed Persian polymath Omar Khayyam, whose contributions spanned various disciplines including Mathematics, Astronomy, Philosophy, and Poetry, the Khayyam Challenge embodies the multidimensional nature of Persian language understanding.\nThis benchmark covers 38 subjects, including Mathematics and Physics, which require reasoning and computational ability, to humanities and social sciences, demanding nuanced understanding and cultural sensitivity. Unlike the previous Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU (Khashabi et al., 2021  ###reference_b13###), our benchmark includes more diverse topics in addition to different educational stages.\nMoreover, our dataset distinguishes itself from previous efforts like ParSQuAD (Abadani et al., 2021  ###reference_b1###) by being originally constructed in Persian, naturally incorporating the nuanced semantics and intricacies inherent to the language itself, rather than solely focusing on literal translations.\nUnlike PersianQA (Ayoubi, 2021  ###reference_b4###) and PQuAD (Darvishi et al., 2023  ###reference_b7###), which are extractive datasets where models are tasked with extracting answers from given paragraphs and questions, our benchmark offers a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. This is because the task of answer extraction alone may not sufficiently assess the models’ overall language understanding and reasoning capabilities.\nOur proposed dataset contains “Iran’s national university entrance”, and Kanoon Farhangi Amoozesh (Cultural Educational Center), wherein questions are not only verified and validated by experts in each subject but also accompanied by metadata for each question. This metadata includes the difficulty level, a descriptive answer, educational stage, subject, and the specific topic of the question. Through the Khayyam Challenge, we aim to provide a holistic evaluation framework that reflects the diverse linguistic and cognitive challenges inherent in processing Persian text across various domains.\nIn our evaluations, we assessed several state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023  ###reference_b16###), Aya (Üstün et al., 2024  ###reference_b20###), PersianMind (Rostami et al., 2024  ###reference_b17###), mGPT (Shliazhko et al., 2022  ###reference_b18###), mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2022  ###reference_b15###), Claude3-haiku (Anthropic, 2024  ###reference_b3###), and XVERSE111https://github.com/xverse-ai, all purportedly equipped with some level of understanding of the Persian language. Our findings indicate that while most of these models struggle to grasp Persian nuances, particularly evident in domains such as Calculus, Logic, and Geometry where accurate comprehension is essential, some exhibit comparatively better performance in contexts reliant on contextual understanding, such as Economics, Psychology, and Social studies. Notably, GPT-4 showcased relatively improved performance across multiple domains. However, there remains a clear imperative need for further enhancements across all models, especially in technical disciplines like Discrete Mathematics, where precise language comprehension is paramount for meaningful outcomes.\nFurthermore, our evaluation unveiled new insights. We observed dependencies between the perceived difficulty of questions for humans versus LLMs. While both encounter similar challenges in tackling difficult questions, LLMs like GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy compared to humans, in questions intentionally designed to deceive, referred to as trapped questions.\nMoreover, our analysis identified biases in certain language models’ responses, such as GPT-3.5 favoring particular choices, suggesting room for further improvement in these models.\nOverall, the Khayyam Challenge (PersianMMLU) marks a significant step forward in evaluating the language understanding and abilities of LLMs that support\nthe Persian language."

            "text": "Over the past few years, there has been a significant improvement in the performance of language models. This progress has been observed in line with the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), thanks to the increasing size of training datasets, enhanced processing power, and new evolved model architectures. The continuing process of scaling the models resulted in LLMs like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Claude3, mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2022), XVERSE, Aya (Üstün et al., 2024), etc. Even though AI models are highly capable of solving various tasks, they continue to encounter difficulties when it comes to real-world problems that, for example, require strong reasoning abilities or complex mathematical calculations (Chang et al., 2024; Zhong et al., 2023). Therefore, we need to assess the effectiveness of these models in solving high-level tasks. This enables us to identify the weak points of the models and work towards improving them in the future. Despite some of the recent LLMs being multilingual, studies indicate that their effectiveness is not as pronounced in non-Latin or low-resource languages as it is in English (Zhang et al., 2023). Consequently, it is essential to assess multilingual LLMs on tasks that employ languages other than English.\n\nAI in healthcare diagnostics has shown significant promise, leveraging machine learning models to improve disease detection and prediction accuracy (Chowdhury et al., 2023). Models like neural networks assist in processing complex datasets, providing insights that could enhance early diagnosis and individualized treatment plans (Liu et al., 2024). However, challenges remain in ensuring model transparency and addressing data bias, which require ongoing research (Patel et al., 2024)."

            "text": "Several benchmarks have been developed to assess the performance of LLMs. One of the most significant benchmarks is MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021  ###reference_b10###), which evaluates language models for answering multiple-choice questions in 57 different tasks, but only in English. M3Exam (Zhang et al., 2023  ###reference_b22###) introduces a multilingual, multimodal, and multilevel benchmark for evaluating LLMs including more than 12K multiple-choice questions from 9 languages (excluding Persian) at three educational stages. AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023  ###reference_b23###) is another benchmark that assesses the performance of LLMs on human-centric standardized exams in English and Chinese languages to measure their ability in human-level tasks. There have been a few benchmarks built to assess language models on the Persian language, including ParSQUAD (Abadani et al., 2021  ###reference_b1###), PersianQA (Ayoubi, 2021  ###reference_b4###), ParsiNLU (Khashabi et al., 2021  ###reference_b13###), and PQuAD (Darvishi et al., 2023  ###reference_b7###), in which some of their features are compared in Table 2  ###reference_###. ParSQUAD, PersianQA, and PQuAD present extractive datasets where models are asked to extract answers from given paragraphs. While this task can gauge models’ reading comprehension skills, it may not effectively evaluate general capabilities and inherent knowledge of models. ParsiNLU evaluates language models based on 14500 questions from six language understanding tasks, including multiple-choice QA (MCQA), sentiment analysis, and more (Table 2  ###reference_###). However, the questions in this benchmark fail to reach human-level complexity, thus inadequately assessing important skills of LLMs, including complex reasoning, needed for solving higher educational stages questions. Moreover, ParsiNLU covers only three subject tasks in MCQA and lacks adequate metadata, such as question difficulty levels. This deficiency further restricts our capacity to evaluate the model’s proficiency across specific tasks and different difficulty levels. To address this gap, we introduce Khayyam Challenge, which features multiple-choice questions sourced from high-standard exams, and contains reach metadata to evaluate the innate knowledge and human-like skills of LLMs across different difficulty levels and educational stages.\n\nIn the domain of AI in healthcare diagnostics, numerous studies highlight its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy (Esteva et al., 2017), streamline patient data analysis (Rajkomar et al., 2018), and support clinical decision-making (Topol, 2019). These advancements are poised to revolutionize medical diagnostics through timely and precise disease detection."

Primary education is split into lower primary school (LPS) for the first 3 years, followed by upper primary school (UPS) for the next 3 years. Secondary education is similarly divided, with lower secondary school (LSS) encompassing the first 3 years, and upper secondary school (USS) comprising the final 3 years."

            "text": "The Khayyam Challenge is enriched with valuable metadata that elevates its utility beyond a simple aggregation of questions. This metadata includes:\n###table_1### ###figure_1### ###figure_2### Educational Stage: Specifies the educational stage for which the question is intended (LPS, UPS, LSS, USS), allowing for the assessment of appropriateness and difficulty relative to the expected knowledge base at each stage of education.\nDifficulty Level: Each question is classified into one of five distinct difficulty levels: easy, relatively easy, medium, relatively difficult, and difficult. This nuanced categorization allows a detailed analysis of question difficulty and examinee performance.\nDescriptive Answers: In addition to the correct answer, our dataset provides a detailed explanation for each question. This is crucial for understanding the reasoning behind the correct answer, facilitating a deeper comprehension of the question.\nTrap: Human experts have identified if a question contains a ”trap” choice—an incorrect answer that might be easily mistaken for the correct one. These questions are referred to as ”trapped questions” and are generally more challenging, with the majority classified as difficult. This helps in understanding common misconceptions and the effectiveness of question design in truly testing knowledge and reasoning abilities.\nHuman Performance: This metric quantifies the percentage of students answering a question correctly.\nSpecific Topic: Questions are meticulously categorized into detailed subjects, such as ”Mathematics ¿ Discrete Maths ¿ Combinatorics.” This detailed classification enables targeted analysis of exam content and provides insights into the distribution and depth of questions across various subjects.\nYear: Indicates the year when the question was designed, which can provide insights into the evolution of question complexity and educational standards over time.\nThe inclusion of this metadata is not merely for augmentative purposes; it serves a critical role in enabling comprehensive analyses that can benefit educators, researchers, and developers of educational technologies. Specifically, it allows for the comparison of performance between human examinees and LLMs on specific topics under varying difficulty levels. By assessing whether LLMs fall for the traps as humans or how they approach questions requiring complex thought processes, we can gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current AI technologies in educational contexts.\nMoreover, the presence of descriptive answers supports the development of more sophisticated AI models by facilitating ”chain of thought” processing, where the model learns to approach a problem step-by-step, mirroring human problem-solving methods. This not only enhances the model’s problem-solving skills but also its ability to explain its reasoning in a manner that is understandable to humans."

Furthermore, in our analysis, we considered human accuracy by examining our comprehensive metadata containing response percentages for each question choice. We chose the answer selected by humans if the combined total of the remaining three options was lower.\nIn the Single Token Probability approach, applied to models providing token probabilities, we calculated the softmax probability of tokens and selected the most probable tokens from 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Persian as the response. As for the Full Answer Probability method as we can see at formula 1  ###reference_###, we tokenized the text of each choice, computed the sum of the logarithm of token probabilities for each option, standardized it to the length of each option, and chose the most likely option as the answer.\nOur analysis shows that the Regex method has the highest accuracy, whereas the full prob method demonstrated a significant decrease in accuracy compared to the other two approaches."

In subjects like mathematics, this gap widens to 50% accuracy for GPT-4. This exhibits a real challenge of current LLMs in solving human-level questions, especially in complex mathematical questions that need high-level mathematical calculation and reasoning skills.\nThe models exhibit weaker performance in mathematics and natural science main categories compared to humanities and social sciences. This indicates their weaker performance on questions requiring high reasoning skills, compared to those mainly reliant on models’ inherent knowledge.

            "text": "To explore how humans and LLMs perceive the difficulty of questions, we examined the accuracy of different models across three difficulty levels. Although our dataset included five labels ranging from easy to difficult to denote question difficulty, we combined the two relatively easy and relatively difficult labels into “easy” and “difficult”, respectively, to ensure a more balanced distribution of question difficulty. Our experiment revealed a consistent trend: as question difficulty increased, both human and model answering accuracy decreased (See Tables 12  ###reference_###, 13  ###reference_###, 14  ###reference_### in the Appendix E  ###reference_###).\nNotably, in analytical and knowledge-based topics such as the humanities category, the GPT-4 model demonstrated superior performance compared to humans in tackling difficult questions. Conversely, models exhibiting more human-like performance, such as GPT-4, revealed that humans significantly outperformed them on easier questions.\nFor additional statistical results, refer to Appendix G  ###reference_###."

            "text": "We introduced Khayyam Challenge, also known as PersianMMLU, as the first framework for assessing LLMs in the Persian language across various tasks, difficulty levels, and educational stages. This framework includes comprehensive metadata such as human performance, difficulty levels, and traps. Our assessment encompassed examining the performance of current LLMs on these datasets, evaluating their ability to extract answers (probabilistic and rule-based paradigms), and considering various aspects highlighted in the metadata. Our findings revealed that while LLMs demonstrated relatively satisfactory performance in question-solving tasks (especially on GPT-4), they still significantly lagged behind human performance, particularly in tasks necessitating reasoning. Moreover, analysis of metadata concerning difficulty levels and trapped questions unveiled notable discrepancies between model and human behavior, suggesting fundamental differences in learning approaches. This underscores the necessity for adaptations in LLMs training methodologies to achieve human-like proficiency. For future works, we aim to develop an LLM that bridges the performance gap between existing open-source models and GPT-4."
