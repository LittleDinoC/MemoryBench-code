    "title": "DMON: A Simple yet Effective Approach for Argument Structure Learning",
    "abstract": "Argument structure learning (ASL) entails predicting relations between arguments.\nBecause it can structure a document to facilitate its understanding, it has been widely applied in many fields (medical, commercial, and scientific domains).\nDespite its broad utilization, ASL remains a challenging task because it involves examining the complex relationships between the sentences in a potentially unstructured discourse.\nTo resolve this problem, we have developed a simple yet effective approach called Dual-tower Multi-scale cOnvolution neural Network (DMON) for the ASL task.\nSpecifically, we organize arguments into a relationship matrix that together with the argument embeddings forms a relationship tensor and design a mechanism to capture relations with contextual arguments.\nExperimental results on three different-domain argument mining datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/VRCMF/DMON.git.\n\n\n\nKeywords: argument structure learning, argument mining",

(2020  ###reference_b22###); Stylianou and Vlahavas (2021  ###reference_b29###), legal reasoning Poudyal et al. (2020  ###reference_b28###), and opinion mining Niculae et al. (2017  ###reference_b26###).\nDespite of its broad application, solving the ASL task is still challenging due to the complexity of text structures and diversity of relationships.\nMoreover, real-world data often contains inconsistencies and are largely unstructured.\nFully understanding the relationship between two arguments often require contextual knowledge from other arguments, or even their relationships.\nA key challenge posed by ASL is that fully understanding the relationship between two arguments often requires capturing contextual knowledge about other arguments and their relationships.\nIn Figure 1  ###reference_###, to classify the relationship ,\nexamples of contextual argument relationships are  and .\nMayer et al.

Most papers tackle argument relationship classification by performing pairwise ASL and classifying two concatenated sentences due to it simplicity and effectiveness Mayer et al. (2020  ###reference_b22###); Stylianou and Vlahavas (2021  ###reference_b29###); Galassi et al. (2021  ###reference_b12###). In Hua and Wang (2022  ###reference_b13###), argument components and their contextual sentences were encoded together using a RoBERTa encoder to obtain neighboring arguments information. The experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contextual information enhances performance. This method primarily relies on self-attention to capture relationships between the concatenated sentences. However, self-attention can be computationally expensive as it involves computing a pairwise similarity matrix for every token in all argument components. In this paper we explicitly model contextual argumentative relationships and, given that a convolution operation can effectively capture input-data features Alzubaidi et al. (2021  ###reference_b1###); Andreoli (2019  ###reference_b2###); Dumoulin and Visin (2016  ###reference_b7###), we utilize convolutional modules to represent a pair of arguments and contextual pairs of arguments. \n\nThe integration of AI in autonomous vehicles is an evolving research field showing significant promise in enhancing driving safety and efficiency. Neural networks, especially deep learning models, have been instrumental in processing sensor data to enable autonomous decision-making Chen et al. (2015  ###reference_b10###); Bojarski et al.

The AbstRCT (of which Neoplasm is a part) and CDCP are imbalanced and have a high ratio of sentence pairs that exhibit no argumentative relationship (\"unrelated\" relationship).\nThis could be a reason why DMON has somewhat lower performance gains.\nOn the other hand, AbstRCT and CDCP have few relationship types and it might be that the baselines already deal with these in a satisfactory way, while they have more difficulties with the 27 relationship types of SciDTB.\nFor this more difficult case of argumentative structure learning, DMON has the highest gains in performamce and improves the average macro-F1 scores by , , and  percentage points on all 27 relationship type, on the \"unrelated\" class and on the other 26 relationships, respectively.\nLarge Language Models:\nAs large language models capture the attention of the NLP communities, we conduct a comparison of LLMs with the proposed algorithm.\nWe pick the GPT 3.5 turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613), a widely used LLM, and validate it on the ASL task.\nWe use the in-context prompt learning (ICL) Brown et al. (2020  ###reference_b4###) to validate the ASL task.\nWe found the zero-shot ICL is much worse than the few-shot ICL, so we reported the results of the GPT 3.5 turbo by using the few-shot ICL method.\nExperimental results show the number of the demonstration samples is 2.\nWe report the Macro-F1 scores of the GPT 3.5 on the AbstRCT (gla), AbstRCT (neo), AbstRCT (mix), CDCP and SciDTB datasets, which are 12.03, 13.84, 11.19, 11.89, and 17.24, respectively.\nResults of the GPT 3.5 turbo are much lower than the fine-tuned models, i.e., our DMON model, whose scores are 73.16, 76.30, 74.07, 87.36, and 68.14.\nWe think the reason why the GPT 3.5 performs badly on the ASL datasets is because LLMs fail to deal with tasks which require complex reasoning ability.\n###figure_5### ###figure_6### ###figure_7### ###figure_8### ###figure_9###"
