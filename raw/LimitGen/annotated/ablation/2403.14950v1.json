            "text": "In the era of large language models (LLMs) with billions and possibly trillions of parameters Du et al. (2022  ###reference_b8###); OpenAI (2023  ###reference_b27###); Touvron et al. (2023a  ###reference_b43###), parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) stands out as a crucial technique enabling the necessary adaptation of LLMs to downstream tasks.\nIt freezes most or even all parameters of LLMs and only finetunes a small number of parameters using limited instruction data.\nLoRA Hu et al. (2022  ###reference_b11###) is a widely-used PEFT method that trains small low-rank adapters to approximate the large layers in LLMs.\nFollow-up work improves the efficiency of LoRA by using quantized weights Dettmers et al. (2023  ###reference_b6###).\nIn this work, we seek to improve the effectiveness of LoRA while preserving comparable efficiency.\nInspired by knowledge-injected pre-trained language models (PLMs), e.g., ERNIE Zhang et al. (2019  ###reference_b55###),\nwe explore knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the PEFT of LLMs with LoRA.\nA KG is a large-scale structured knowledge base containing a massive amount of trustworthy knowledge.\nThe typical way of injecting KGs into PLMs in the past few years is incorporating pre-trained entity embeddings at the input layer of a PLM and finetuning the full model on NLP tasks  Lauscher et al. (2019  ###reference_b15###); Peters et al. (2019  ###reference_b28###); Yang et al. (2019  ###reference_b50###); Zhang et al. (2019  ###reference_b55###); Levine et al. (2020  ###reference_b16###); Liu et al. (2021  ###reference_b22###); Lu et al. (2021  ###reference_b23###); Wang et al. (2022  ###reference_b49###).\nKnowledge injection has improved many PLMs, e.g., BERT Devlin et al. (2019  ###reference_b7###) and RoBERTa Zhuang et al. (2021  ###reference_b56###).\nHowever, previous knowledge injection methods require fully tuning PLMs, which is inapplicable to LLMs.\nFurthermore, these methods are founded on the encoder-based architecture of PLMs, and their effectiveness for recent decoder-based LLMs remains unknown.\nThe following questions thereby arise: Can knowledge injection still enhance the PEFT of LLMs? Also, how can knowledge injection be used to enhance PEFT?\nTo answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a knowledgeable adaptation method for PEFT, particularly for LoRA, called KnowLA.\nIt inserts an adaptation layer into a pre-trained LLM.\nThe layer integrates external KG embeddings of entities appearing in the input text of the LLM.\nEntity embeddings and parameters of the LLM are frozen in PEFT.\nThe proposed adaptation layer is trained combined with LoRA on instruction data.\nThe parameters in our adaptation layer are significantly fewer than those in the LLM and even fewer than those in LoRA.\nThus, our KnowLA is also a parameter-efficient method without changing the original parameters of the LLM.\nWe evaluate KnowLA on six datasets, including commonsense reasoning on CommonsenseQA Talmor et al. (2019  ###reference_b40###), social interaction reasoning on SIQA Sap et al. (2019  ###reference_b29###) and BIG-Bench Hard Suzgun et al. (2023  ###reference_b39###), single-hop reasoning of KBQA on WebQuestionSP Yih et al. (2016  ###reference_b51###), and close-book QA on TriviaQA Joshi et al. (2017  ###reference_b14###) and TruthfulQA Lin et al. (2022  ###reference_b19###).\nExperimental results show that KnowLA can enhance the effectiveness of LoRA at the expense of a limited number of additional parameters.\nEven when compared to Alpaca2 Taori et al. (2023  ###reference_b42###), which has a larger LoRA with a similar number of parameters, KnowLA with a smaller LoRA achieves better results.\nWe assess the robustness of KnowLA with two popular foundation models (i.e., LLaMA 1 Touvron et al. (2023a  ###reference_b43###) and Llama 2 Touvron et al. (2023b  ###reference_b44###)), different instruction data (i.e., instruction-following demonstrations in Alpaca2 and Vicuna2 Chiang et al. (2023  ###reference_b4###)), various KGs (i.e., WordNet Miller (1995  ###reference_b25###), ConceptNet Speer et al. (2017  ###reference_b34###), and Wikidata Vrandecic and Krötzsch (2014  ###reference_b45###)), and typical embedding learning models (i.e., RESCAL Nickel et al. (2011  ###reference_b26###), TransE Bordes et al. (2013  ###reference_b2###), and RotatE Sun et al. (2019  ###reference_b38###)), combined with two PEFT methods (i.e., LoRA Hu et al. (2022  ###reference_b11###) and AdaLoRA Zhang et al. (2023  ###reference_b54###)).\nExperiments show that KnowLA can offer stable improvements.\nTo understand how KnowLA changes the output of an LLM, we analyze the results from two perspectives, which show several interesting findings:\n(i) KnowLA with LoRA can align the space of the LLM with the space of KG embeddings, and\n(ii) KnowLA can activate the parameterized potential knowledge that originally exists in the LLM, even though the used KG does not contain such knowledge.\nAccording to our findings, in some cases, the LLM outputs incorrect answers not because it does not know the answers, but because its relevant knowledge is not activated by the input prompts.\nKnowLA can help activate its relevant knowledge without changing its parameters or input prompts."

(2019  ###reference_b55###); Lu et al. (2021  ###reference_b23###); Wang et al. (2021b  ###reference_b48###).\nExisting works incorporate entity embeddings for classification tasks, and their knowledge injection modules are independent of PLMs.\nThis poses challenges to aligning the semantic spaces of entity embeddings and PLMs.\nThese knowledge injection methods also necessitate updating the entire model of PLMs.\nThe second method converts relevant triples in KGs into natural language sentences used for pre-training PLMs Liu et al. (2020  ###reference_b21###); Sun et al. (2020  ###reference_b35###, 2021  ###reference_b36###).\nThe third method introduces adapters into PLMs to enable them to learn KGs Wang et al. (2021a  ###reference_b46###).\nOur KnowLA relates to the first type of methods.\nIt is also a variant of the third method.\nHowever, previous methods are built on PLMs while our method is the first attempt to LLMs.\nKnowLA does not update the parameters of LLMs.\nIt employs a knowledge adapter during PEFT to enhance the LLM’s capabilities.\nThe injected entity knowledge can also be deeply integrated with the LLM’s knowledge in subsequent decoding steps.\nApart from the above work injecting knowledge inside the model, there are also methods retrieving and augmenting relevant knowledge on the input side of the model Shwartz et al. (2020  ###reference_b33###); Izacard et al. (2022  ###reference_b13###); Liu et al. (2022  ###reference_b20###); Baek et al.

(2022  ###reference_b20###) generates relevant prompt text using a sophisticated LLM.\nKAPING Baek et al. (2023  ###reference_b1###) retrieves relevant triples in KGs.\n###figure_1###"

(2023), we use the subtree labels provided by the constituent tree to extract all noun phrases from the textual answers, calculate their similarities, and determine the correctness of answers exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5). The accuracy results are shown in Table 2. We find that Alpaca2 obtains better performance than Alpaca2. The reason may be that more parameters in LoRA are prone to overfitting in the closed-book QA tasks. Moreover, Contriever (Wikipedia) only slightly exceeds Alpaca2 and performs better than KAPING. This is because KAPING cannot guarantee the correctness of the extracted triples. According to the results, KnowLA combined with WordNet improves the results on TriviaQA, while combined with ConceptNet, the performance is further enhanced. This indicates that the parameterized entity embeddings can enrich the textual representations. The experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-enhanced textual representations after finetuning with LoRA can help mitigate the hallucination problem of Llama 2 to some extent. On WebQuestionSP, KnowLA (WordNet) and KnowLA (Wikidata) produce similar results. Also, the two Alpaca2 models with different ranks perform similarly. This suggests that the reasoning ability of Alpaca2 is good on this task, and the performance does not change significantly after knowledge enhancement with KnowLA. We attribute this bottleneck to the model size and the training data of Llama 2 and Alpaca2."

Alpaca2 still underperforms Alpaca2. This further substantiates our conclusion that larger parameters do not necessarily guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the model’s output. KnowLA (ConceptNet) performs best among these models, which indicates that the integration of our KnowLA with LoRA can mitigate the hallucination problem of Llama 2 to some extent and generate content of better quality.

By examining the answers of the three models in Case 2, it can be observed that Alpaca2 does not provide an accurate and relevant response, which is similar to the content generated by KnowLA (Wikidata). They both generate deceptive answers. However, after incorporating ConceptNet, KnowLA accurately provides the correct answer in the response. According to Table 2 ###reference_###, we believe that the enhancement is not accidental. Moreover, by examining the token-to-entity linking results, we find that the answer entity “Boojum” does not exist in ConceptNet.
