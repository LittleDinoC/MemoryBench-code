    "title": "PSYDIAL: Personality-based Synthetic Dialogue Generation using Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "We present a novel end-to-end personality-based synthetic dialogue data generation pipeline, specifically designed to elicit responses from large language models via prompting. We design the prompts to generate more human-like dialogues considering real-world scenarios when users engage with chatbots. We introduce PSYDIAL, the first Korean dialogue dataset focused on personality-based dialogues, curated using our proposed pipeline. Notably, we focus on the Extraversion dimension of the Big Five personality model in our research. Experimental results indicate that while pre-trained models and those fine-tuned with a chit-chat dataset struggle to generate responses reflecting personality, models trained with PSYDIAL show significant improvements. The versatility of our pipeline extends beyond dialogue tasks, offering potential for other non-dialogue related applications. This research opens doors for more nuanced, personality-driven conversational AI in Korean and potentially other languages. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jiSilverH/psydial.\n\n\n\nKeywords: synthetic dialogue generation, personality-based dialogue, large language model",

            "text": "Conversations are an integral part of our daily lives, functioning as essential social interactions intrinsic to human existence. Over the years, researchers have endeavored to replicate these interactions with language models, hoping to enable conversations with machines that reflect our everyday experiences.\nThe emergence of generative pre-trained models has brought us closer to realizing this goal. DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020  ###reference_b27###), an extension of GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019  ###reference_b20###), was specifically designed to support multi-turn dialogue generation by leveraging extensive training on a substantial dialogue dataset. However, it is important to note that the fine-tuning process requires a considerable amount of human-annotated data and presents challenges in terms of construction.\nAn alternative to manually collecting and fine-tuning dialogue data is data augmentation. This technique addresses data scarcity issues. Instead of solely relying on human-curated dialogue datasets, researchers have begun to augment their training datasets Kulhánek et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###); Zheng et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###). This approach aligns with recent shifts in the research community. More recent research efforts have explored the utility of large language models (LLMs) in generating synthetic training datasets, especially for text classification tasks Yu et al. (2023  ###reference_b25###).\nAs we explore this further, it becomes apparent that imbuing machines with personalities can significantly enhance their ability to generate more human-like responses. Just as humans possess unique personalities that shape our conversations, for truly human-like chit-chat dialogues, machines too should be imbued with distinct personalities.\nWhile the field of conversational AI has seen a surge in equipping dialogue agents with distinct personas or roles, as indicated in studies like Jang et al. (2022  ###reference_b6###); Lim et al. (2023  ###reference_b11###), there remains a gap in endowing agents with specific personalities. To address this, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that uses prompting in LLMs to generate a comprehensive synthetic dialogue dataset based on personality. This pipeline comprises 5 steps: Personality setting, Profile selecting, Dialogue generation, Filtering, and Regeneration. Figure 1  ###reference_### provides an overview of our pipeline. Using this pipeline, we have created the Personality-based Synthetic Dialogue dataset (PSYDIAL), which includes approximately 2900 machine-generated conversations. Our personality definitions are based on the Big Five Personality Factors De Raad (2000  ###reference_b5###). Among the five dimensions (Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), we focus primarily on Extraversion due to its discernible nature to human perception, following the previous work Mairesse et al. (2007  ###reference_b15###). We use CHATGPT as our base LLM. Our dataset analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline. Furthermore, our method can be readily extended to other large language models and adapted for generating datasets for various tasks. The key contributions of our work are suggested as follows:\nWe present a pipeline designed for personality-based dialogue generation using LLMs. This end-to-end process is broken down into five distinct steps, each equipped with specialized prompts. A standout feature of our pipeline is its ability to autonomously generate dialogues, minimizing human intervention in most phases.\nWe release a Korean personality-based dialogue dataset enriched with personality nuances, created through our pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that captures Korean dialogues with an emphasis on personality.\nWe conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset gathered using our pipeline and explore the LLM’s perspective on personality.\nWe fine-tune a Korean pre-trained generative model with our dataset to assess its quality. The findings demonstrate that our dataset is both well-formulated and conducive to training personality-reflective models.\nThe data generation framework that we have introduced is universally applicable across languages and tasks, offering a valuable tool for challenges in data synthesis."

            "text": "In an effort to create natural, human-like dialogue models, the predominant approach is to utilize pre-trained language models (PLMs). DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020  ###reference_b27###) built upon GPT2 Radford et al. (2019  ###reference_b20###) by fine-tuning it with a dataset sourced from Reddit for conversational response generation.\nHowever, collecting dialogue data is both tedious and time-consuming. Rather than simply fine-tuning the model on a constructed dataset, an alternative method uses PLMs to augment existing datasets Kulhánek et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###); Zheng et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###). Kulhánek et al. (2021  ###reference_b9###) augmented training dataset by paraphrasing each utterance with Transformer-based models. However, synthetic datasets often serve a supplementary role, typically merged with manually curated dialogue datasets for training purposes.\nAs LLMs have emerged, there has been a notable shift in synthesizing dialogue. Various studies now employ LLMs, using proper prompts to make their targeted datasets. Zheng et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###) utilizes expert-crafted dialogues as in-context examples to steer LLMs toward creating a complete social conversation dataset. Our study also prioritizes generating entire conversations. While expert-crafted dialogues provide valuable guidance, their manual creation is both labor-intensive and yields inconsistencies in quality. To prevent these limitations, we prompt LLMs without in-context examples, enabling the creation of a varied dataset across different topics. To ensure the quality of these generated dialogues, we incorporate a filtering process with the LLMs.\n###figure_1###"

(2023  ###reference_b10###) applied dataset cartography to their method. For their sensitive questions and acceptable response dataset, which was generated by prompting LLMs, they adopted the dataset cartography during the filtering stage. Only the text labeled as ambiguous was re-generated by human annotators. Similarly, Zheng et al. (2023  ###reference_b28###) adopted a heuristic-based post-processing technique to filter the machine-augmented dataset.\nThere are some attempts to evaluate text using LLMs Chiang and yi Lee (2023  ###reference_b4###); Liu et al.

            "text": "Through a series of experiments, we found that when an interlocutor’s profile information is absent, CHATGPT tends to generate dialogues with similar topics. We have observed that when Person ’s personality is described as extroverted, it tends to increase the likelihood that Person  always attends parties. On the contrary, if Person ’s personality is characterized as introverted, CHATGPT tends to suggest that Person  has a preference for reading.\nTo mitigate the issue mentioned above and to generate dialogues rich in topical diversity, we leverage profile information from the PERSONA-CHAT dataset Zhang et al. (2018  ###reference_b26###), which contains at least five profile sentences representing a persona of an individual. A single sentence that corresponds to the defined personality of Person  is chosen from a profile. This specific profile selection for Person  is made with the intention of endowing the dialogue agent with a distinct personality. Additionally, this serves as a dialogue topic and contributes to the generation of diverse dialogues. CHATGPT inherently has the ability to select a profile from a persona based on the designated personality. If the persona sentences do not contain the designated personality, the system outputs \"cannot select the profile\"."

To incorporate this linguistic characteristic, we assign the first style to represent informal speech. This decision also reflects the human dialogue pattern, where interlocutors typically have background information about each other.\nThe second style is determined by who initiates the conversation, mirroring real-world interactions where users generally initiate dialogue with the system. Accordingly, we have incorporated a style where Person , acting as a user, initiates the conversation. This prompt can be extended with any desirable styles."

In contrast, our approach taps into the inherent self-evaluative capacity of LLMs. During this step, CHATGPT is presented with a filtering prompt, designed to assess if the generated dialogue aligns with the outlined personalities, profiles, and styles from §3.3  ###reference_###. This prompt is divided into three specific sub-prompts. Firstly, Profile Filtering determines whether the dialogue accurately represents the given profile information. Next, Personality Filtering encourages the model to recognize and evaluate the depicted personalities, effectively acting as an introspective measure. This plays a pivotal role in enhancing the dataset’s quality. Lastly, we employ Style Filtering to ascertain if the dialogue conforms to an informal Korean speech pattern. You can incorporate additional filtering criteria based on the data generation prompts used during the dialogue creation process."

Although KoDialoGPT is fine-tuned for everyday dialogues, it has difficulty generating text with specific personality traits. Significant improvements in metrics were observed when we trained the models using our dataset (4). Specifically, adjusting the system’s personality to match practical application settings (5) resulted in an accuracy increase of up to 88%. This clearly highlights the importance of setting the system’s personality. A comparison of pre-trained models with adjusted system personality settings (2) shows that pre-trained models fail to reflect the interlocutor’s personality adequately.

            "text": "We introduce an end-to-end pipeline for generating synthetic dialogue data, leveraging the prompting method with Large Language Models. This five-step process is based on real-world situations where a user interacts with a chatbot. This pipeline can easily be applied to various dialogue tasks and even non-dialogue related tasks. We also present PSYDIAL, a pioneering Korean dialogue dataset curated from this pipeline, focused on personality-based dialogues. Models trained on our dataset showed varied performance levels, highlighting the importance of our dataset and its training approach. For future research, exploring optimal prompts for LLMs, enhancing the personality-based dataset, and expanding the range of personality dimensions offer promising directions."

            "text": "Firstly, we have not explored multiple personality dimensions. However, with minimal adjustments to our pipeline, we can synthesize dialogues involving interlocutors with multiple personalities.\nSecond, the ability of CHATGPT to generate Korean dialogues leaves room for improvement. Certain phrases come across as unnatural, akin to direct translations from English into Korean, making it challenging to create natural-sounding Korean utterances.\nThirdly, during the Profile Selecting process (§3.2  ###reference_###), there is a possibility of selecting similar profile sentences. The PERSONA-CHAT data was formulated by revising collected personas. Consequently, when we used sentence embedding clustering on these profile sentences, we encountered numerous similar entries. This can impact the topical diversity in dialogue generation.\nLastly, during the Dialogue Regeneration (§3.5  ###reference_###), we regenerate negative dialogues three times. The number of regenerations is decided heuristically. Therefore, a thorough experiment to determine the optimal number of regenerations should be conducted."
