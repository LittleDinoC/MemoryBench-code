    "abstract": "There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence (Hutter, 2006).\nRecently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression,\nwhich offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence.\nDespite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence.\nIn this work, we examine\ntheir relationship\nin the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors.\nGiven the abstract concept of “intelligence”, we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning.\nAcross 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 30 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations.\nRemarkably, we find that LLMs’ intelligence – reflected by average benchmark scores – almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora.\nThese results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence.\nFurthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities.\nWe open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.111https://github.com/hkust-nlp/llm-compression-intelligence.",

            "text": "The belief that compression is closely connected to intelligence has been held for a long time, with some researchers suggesting that they are fundamentally equivalent (Hernández-Orallo & Minaya-Collado, 1998  ###reference_b26###; Mahoney, 1999  ###reference_b40###; Legg et al., 2005  ###reference_b33###; Hutter, 2006  ###reference_b27###; Legg & Hutter, 2007  ###reference_b32###).\nThis notion becomes even more compelling in light of the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their implications for AI, leading to an exploration of language modeling from a compression standpoint.\nAccording to compression theory, any predictive model can be transformed into a lossless compressor and vice versa. Thus, language modeling can be considered a form of compression, with LLMs showing strong capabilities in data compression empirically (Deletang et al., 2024  ###reference_b16###).\nFrom this viewpoint, the argument that compression leads to intelligence becomes more relevant to the current paradigm of AI based on LLMs. Yet, despite these theoretical discussions, empirical evidence on the relationship between compression and intelligence remains limited. In this work, we seek to conduct such empirical study and answer: If a language model can encode a text corpus with fewer bits in a lossless manner, does that indicate greater intelligence?\nWhile the precise definition of “intelligence” often ventures into philosophical territory and can vary significantly, our work approaches “intelligence” from a practical standpoint, focusing on the model’s ability to complete various downstream tasks.\nThis treatment aligns with the definition from Hutter (2006  ###reference_b27###), who notes that “intelligence is an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments”.\nWe measure intelligence along three key abilities: knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning.\nSpecifically, we begin by collecting external raw corpora in the respective domain (e.g. GitHub code for the coding ability) and evaluate the efficiency of various LLMs in compressing the corpus.\nSubsequently, we assess these models on a range of downstream tasks, using the average benchmark scores to gauge their domain-specific intelligence.\nThe goal is to examine the correlation between the models’ downstream ability and their compression efficiency.\nOn experiments across 30 public LLMs and 12 diverse benchmarks, we uncover a remarkable finding: LLMs’ downstream ability is almost linearly correlated with their compression efficiency, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of around -0.95 for each evaluated domain of intelligence as shown in Figure 1  ###reference_###.\nNotably, this linear relationship even extends to most individual benchmarks as well.\nRecent and concurrent works have explored the relationship between benchmark scores and compression-equivalent metrics like validation loss within the same model series, where the model checkpoints share most configurations such as model designs, tokenizers, and data (Wei et al., 2023  ###reference_b57###; Gadre et al., 2024  ###reference_b19###; Du et al., 2024  ###reference_b17###). Our study, however, is the first to document a linear correlation between compression and intelligence in LLMs across varying model sizes, tokenizers, context window lengths, and pretraining data distributions. Our findings establish the linear correlation between compression and intelligence as a universal principle, providing empirical support for the longstanding belief that superior compression is indicative of greater intelligence.\nFrom a practical perspective, compression efficiency serves as an unsupervised metric for LLMs where the text corpora can be easily updated to avoid overfitting or test contamination.\nOur findings advocate for adopting compression efficiency as a stable, flexible, and reliable metric to evaluate LLMs, which is linearly correlated with the models’ abilities.\nWe open-source our compression corpora, as well as the data collection and processing pipelines so that future researchers can easily collect and update their own corpora to assess compression."

            "text": "The discussion on the equivalence between language modeling and compression has a long history (Shannon, 1948  ###reference_b48###; 1951  ###reference_b49###).\nRecently,\nDeletang et al. (2024  ###reference_b16###) have echoed this connection and demonstrated that language models are general-purpose compressors empirically. Below, we briefly introduce the background to acquaint readers with such a relationship.\nSuppose  is the underlying distribution to generate the text sequence data.\nGiven a text sequence , lossless compression seeks to encode it into a code  that is smaller in size while preserving all original information.\nWe typically use binary bits as the coding alphabet of .\nAccording to the source coding theorem (Shannon, 1948  ###reference_b48###), the expected number of bits of an optimal encoder is equal to , which is the minimum average number of bits that one can achieve on compressing text from  in a lossless manner.\nKnowing , a common approach to achieve such optimal compression is arithmetic coding (Rissanen, 1976  ###reference_b45###; Pasco, 1977  ###reference_b42###),\nwhich is a practical approach to optimally encode data with a probabilistic model. We refer the readers to Deletang et al. (2024  ###reference_b16###) for more details on arithmetic coding for autoregressive language models.\nIn practice, however,  is often unknown, and we can use a language model  to help compress  efficiently.\nIntuitively, we seek to utilize  to encode rare sequences with more bits and the frequent ones with fewer bits.\nArithmetic coding is able to achieve the optimal expected code length (in bits) as:\nwhich establishes the connection between  and compressors. To achieve more efficient compression, we aim to optimize  to minimize the average code length in Eq. 1  ###reference_###.\nNoting that Eq. 1  ###reference_### is exactly the cross-entropy loss that is used to train language models, learning to compress well is equivalent to language modeling.222Libraries like PyTorch often implement the cross entropy loss with the log base of  rather than , which causes a constant coefficient difference. Yet, it does not influence the equivalence.\nThis implies that if a language model has a lower loss on the data to be compressed, it will be able to compress it with fewer bits in a lossless manner.\nStrictly speaking, one needs to access the language model parameters to recover the original data from the code, thus the bits required to encode these parameters should be counted as well. However, such a cost can be amortized and becomes negligible when the model is used to compress a substantially large volume of data.\nThere are online or offline settings to compress a data stream. In the online setting, the model is randomly initialized and trained on the data to be compressed. In the offline setting, the model is trained on external data and adopted to compress a different dataset.\nWe focus on the offline setting in this paper, using pretrained language models to compress external corpora."

            "text": "Our goal is to empirically examine the relationship between compression and intelligence in the context of large language models.\nOur method is to investigate a variety of pretrained LLMs of different sizes and from diverse organizations, assessing their compression efficiency and “intelligence” respectively.\nThen we aim to summarize the potential relationship between compression and intelligence based on the evaluation results.\nOur overall principle is to collect diverse LLMs that are created with different training data, tokenizers, computation, and even architectures (e.g., mixture of experts as in MistralAI (2023  ###reference_b41###)), so that our conclusion on compression and intelligence is general and agnostic to specific model series.\nNext, we detail our experimental protocols to evaluate compression and intelligence.\nAccording to §2  ###reference_###, we evaluate the model’s compression efficiency using the average coding length per message of compressing a given corpus.\nDue to the variety of tokenizers employed by different LLMs, the average bits per token are not directly comparable. Therefore, we utilize the average bits per character (BPC) as the metric. BPC is a commonly used compression metric for compressing text, such as in enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011  ###reference_b39###).

This is because a larger context window offers more information to predict the next token’s distribution and allows for encoding with fewer bits, as illustrated in Eq. 2  ###reference_###.\nHowever, in downstream benchmarks where input lengths are short, the benefit of extended context windows diminishes.\nThis applies to all our benchmarks in Table 1  ###reference_###, where the inputs do not exceed 2048 tokens, even in few-shot in-context learning scenarios.\nBasically, the downstream tasks in our study only reflect the model’s intelligence when operating within relatively short contexts. To study its correlation with compression, it is crucial to assess compression using comparable context length, ensuring consistency in the models’ access to information during both corpus compression and execution of downstream tasks.\nTherefore, for all our compression and benchmark evaluations across different LLMs, we unify the context window size to be 1900 tokens that are sufficient for all benchmark evaluation.\nIdeally, a more holistic evaluation of intelligence should incorporate tasks involving both short and long contexts.\nHowever, in this paper, our focus is on the short- or medium-context regime, which encompasses the majority of benchmark tasks. We leave the exploration of long-context scenarios for future work.\nApart from context window unification, we utilize a sliding window approach to evaluate compression more accurately, as detailed in Appendix A.1  ###reference_###.\nIn the development of LLMs, there are typically two stages: the pre-training stage and the alignment stage.\nThe models are referred to as base models after the pre-training stage and as fine-tuned models following the alignment stage.\nWe note that fine-tuned models are no longer general-purpose compressors since it does not model the next token distribution for arbitrary text, but only for structured (query, response) data.\nBesides, it is commonly believed that the intelligence of LLMs is learned during the pretraining stage and remains relatively fixed during the alignment stage (Zhou et al., 2023  ###reference_b62###).\nTherefore, in this work, we focus on the base models only, while in §5  ###reference_### we will further discuss the case of compression v.s. intelligence for fine-tuned models.\nWhat kind of corpus shall we select to measure the models’ compression?\nFirstly, it is important to recognize that different corpora can illuminate various aspects of models’ abilities, and compressing one corpus well may not generalize to another (Magnusson et al., 2023  ###reference_b38###).\nTherefore, we would like to select the corpora that align with the areas of our focus.\nSecondly, the chosen corpora should not intersect with the models’ pretraining data to avoid data leakage.\nGiven the opaque status of LLMs’ pretraining datasets, we opt to use the newest corpora as a measure.\nConcretely, for assessing knowledge and commonsense, we have compiled texts from the latest Common Crawl dataset.\nTo evaluate coding ability, we have sourced data from GitHub repositories mainly on the Python language since the downstream benchmarks focus on Python coding abilities.\nFor mathematical reasoning, we collect academic papers from ArXiv, specifically selecting those designated with “math” as their primary category.\nFor each data source, we ensure the recency by utilizing the latest available data at the time of our experiments.

Although the Turing test is probably the most commonly accepted definition for intelligence, the application of the Turing Test as a measure for AI is deemed impractical, primarily because the evaluation’s outcome relies heavily on the subjective judgment of the interrogator.\nMore recently, Legg & Hutter (2007  ###reference_b32###) proposed a definition termed universal intelligence, a broader interpretation than Turing’s focus on human-like intelligence. They\nposited that an agent’s capacity to achieve goals across a wide array of scenarios should define its intelligence.\nThis practical approach to defining intelligence guides our evaluation of models, wherein we assess their intelligence based on average performance across multiple downstream tasks.\nSuch practical evaluation is commonly adopted by most LLM developers to showcase the potential of their models (Touvron et al., 2023a  ###reference_b53###; b  ###reference_b54###; Jiang et al., 2023  ###reference_b28###; Team et al., 2023  ###reference_b52###), and Anthropic (2024  ###reference_b4###) directly noted the “intelligence” of Claude 3 with the average benchmark scores.\nSpecifically, in this paper, we study intelligence along three key abilities: knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning.\nThese abilities represent the most focused LLM areas nowadays, and we collect the well-recognized benchmarks for each of these areas, utilizing their average score to indicate domain-specific intelligence.

(2024  ###reference_b9###) show that when adding multi-choice QA training data, the model is able to achieve over 10 absolute points improvement on multi-choice QA benchmarks such as MMLU, while its performance on general QA benchmarks like TriviaQA remains unchanged.\nIn the math domain, recent researches find that some models heavily optimize towards the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks, while performing poorly on held-out math tests (Paster, 2023  ###reference_b43###).\nIn such scenarios, these benchmark scores are not reliable enough to represent the models’ intelligence in the respective area.\nAlthough we focus on base models in this work, where such overfitting phenomenon may be less common, it is still possible that some LLMs are specially trained on the training data of the corresponding benchmarks in the pretraining stage, or even worse, suffer from test data contamination issues as evidenced in Wei et al.

            "text": "To provide a comprehensive study of the correlation between compression efficiency and intelligence, we include 8 series of general-purpose language models, covering diverse organizations and varying in size, as shown in Table 2  ###reference_###.\nNotably, in addition to dense transformer models, we further include Mixtral-8x7B (MistralAI, 2023  ###reference_b41###), which utilizes a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.\nFurthermore, we incorporate state-of-the-art models specialized in coding and mathematical reasoning in addition to general-purpose models, as outlined in Table 2  ###reference_###.\nWe assess general-purpose LLMs across all benchmarks, while we include code LLMs in the code area only and mathematical LLMs in the mathematical reasoning area only.\nWe note that our investigation focuses exclusively on well-trained LLMs, implying that the intelligence evaluated is likely already manifest, in contrast to models where such abilities have yet to emerge (Wei et al., 2022  ###reference_b56###). This is because LLMs that are not optimized enough tend to perform poorly, where the results are overly noisy and less meaningful, complicating the analysis.\nModels are evaluated using few-shot in-context learning or in a zero-shot manner, adhering to the established norms for the respective benchmarks.\nAll the models are evaluated exactly the same way with the same codebase for a fair comparison. More details on evaluation are included in Appendix A.3  ###reference_###.\nAs described in §3.2  ###reference_###, we utilize bits per character (BPC) as the evaluation metric for compression efficiency.\nTo quantitatively assess the correlation between intelligence and compression, we report the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson ) between the average benchmark scores and BPC.\nBased on preliminary observations that the correlation is highly linear, we perform a linear fit between the average benchmark scores and BPC, and report the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE ) that captures how much the models’ benchmark scores deviate from the linear prediction on average.\nWe extend this analysis to individual benchmarks as well in addition to the average.\nQualitatively, we plot the linear regression results to visualize the relationship, with each model being a point in the figure.\nWe have summarized our main results in Figure 1  ###reference_###, where we examine the overall relationship by computing the average benchmark scores across all three areas, and the average BPC across all the compression corpora. The average score and the average BPC demonstrate a highly linear correlation qualitatively in the visualization.\nQuantitative results with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.94 and an RMSE of 2.8% further verify the linear relationship.\nWe consider such a linear correlation significant given the noisy nature of evaluating on downstream benchmarks – it is known that varying the prompts or decoding hyperparameters could easily cause several points of difference for the task scores (Lu et al., 2022  ###reference_b37###; Gonen et al., 2022  ###reference_b22###; Sclar et al., 2024  ###reference_b47###).\nWe also report the results for the three key areas respectively which demonstrate similar phenomena qualitatively and quantitatively.\nWe note that several previous and concurrent works have studied the correlation between benchmark scores and validation losses in limited settings – they focus on either the model checkpoints of the same model over the course of pretraining or the same model series (Lu et al., 2023  ###reference_b36###; Wei et al., 2023  ###reference_b57###; Gadre et al., 2024  ###reference_b19###; Du et al., 2024  ###reference_b17###). Their studied checkpoints share designs and tokenizers and are pretrained on the same data distributions.\nHowever, our work escapes the constraints on the same model (series) and compares across models that diverge dramatically on tokenizers, model designs, and pretraining data. Our results mark the linear correlation between compression and intelligence in a general manner, establishing it as universal principle.\nThe specific benchmark scores and BPC for every model are reported in Appendix B  ###reference_###.\nNext, we discuss the results in the three areas with more details respectively, and extend the examination to individual benchmarks as well.\n###figure_1### ###figure_2### We present both the average and individual benchmark results for the knowledge and commonsense area in Figure 2  ###reference_###.\nNotably, the scores from individual benchmarks exhibit a strong linear correlation with compression efficiency, indicated by Pearson coefficients of -0.877, -0.947, and -0.888 for HellaSwag, TriviaQA, and MMLU, respectively. The Root Mean Square Error  is approximately 2 absolute points, which falls within the expected range of variation – Minor fluctuations in evaluation details, such as prompt adjustments, can readily account for a 2-point accuracy shift (Sclar et al., 2024  ###reference_b47###).\nMeanwhile, we observe that the linear correlation in both HellaSwag and MMLU is not as pronounced as in TriviaQA, albeit for different reasons. For HellaSwag, the average accuracy among models has exceeded 0.8, hinting at a saturation point in performance that blurs the distinctions between models. Conversely, MMLU, which draws heavily from real-world examinations and textbooks, presents a slight mismatch in distribution compared to the Common Crawl dataset used to measure compression efficiency. Further experiments on MMLU and textbook compression are detailed in Appendix E  ###reference_###, where a Pearson coefficient of -0.926 is observed.\nWe note that for MMLU evaluation, we employ a cloze-style input format for this popular multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmark, presenting only the question without the options,\nand subsequently selecting the choice with the highest likelihood.\nWe intentionally opted for this less conventional evaluation style to minimize the risk of models overfitting to the MCQ format, thus over-optimizing the scores. Please see Appendix D  ###reference_### for detailed discussion and ablation.\nSimilar to the knowledge and commonsense area, there is a strong linear correlation between the models’ compression efficiency and its coding ability, with the Pearson correlation coefficient within  for each individual benchmark.\nFurthermore, despite being of different architectures, the MoE model, Mixtral-8x7B, still fits well into this linear correlation.\nWe notice the strongest linear correlation within the DS-1000 benchmark, with a Pearson coefficient of -0.958, surpassing those of HumanEval and MBPP.\nWe think that this is because we collect Python code from the popular GitHub repositories in recent months, which are mostly related to data science and machine learning, aligned closer with DS-1000.\nWe note that the Deepseek-coder model series are consistently well-above the linear fit, demonstrating strong abilities on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks.\nWe hypothesize that this is due the fact that Deepseek-coder models are exposed to private, task-specific data during pretraining that help HumanEval and MBPP significantly, yet we do not have reliable methods to detect the existance of such data and verify this hypotheis.\n###figure_3### ###figure_4### Overall the correlation results in the mathematical reasoning area are similar to the other two, as shown in Figure 4  ###reference_###.\nHowever,\noverfitting benchmarks in mathematical reasoning warrants particular attention.\nAs described in §3.3  ###reference_###, we compute the MIN-K% Score for every example – which is the average negative log likelihood of the  tokens with the lowest probabilities – on the benchmark test data as well as training data if available.\nAbnormally low MIN-K% Scores imply that the example is likely to be present in the model’s pretraining data.\nWe did not observe abnormal MIN-K% patterns in all the previous experiments, yet, there are models with far lower Min-K% Scores on the GSM8K and MATH datasets than all other models.\nWe visualize the MIN-K% distribution of the training and test examples on both GSM8K and MATH in Figure 5  ###reference_###, which implies that the Qwen model series may be exposed to the GSM8K training data, MATH training data, and even the MATH test data in the pretraining stage.\nTherefore, we spot the Qwen model series in our visualization and exclude them when performing the linear fit and compute the correlation metrics.\nAs expected, the three Qwen models achieve generally higher accuracies than the predicted performance from the linear fit, and appear as outliers in Figure 4  ###reference_###.\nAt last, we highlight that the strongly linear correlation between the single benchmark scores and compression efficiency was originally unexpected, because individual benchmark scores are typically too noisy to represent models’ general ability.\nHowever, current findings indicate that these individual scores may be predictable from the BPC with a minor error in most cases indicated by small RMSE.\nIn the previous experiments, we intentionally selected the appropriate compression corpora aligning with the area of focus. Herein, we further explore the effects of diverse compression corpora on the results. We investigate two representative examples where the compression corpus does not align with the specific domain, to study whether an arbitrary compression corpus would suffice for a strong linear correlation: (1) mathematical reasoning benchmarks v.s. compression on Common Crawl data, and (2) knowledge and commonsense benchmarks v.s. compression on GitHub code data. We present the findings in Figure 7  ###reference_###.\nDue to a substantial ability mismatch between the compression corpus and the benchmarks, the linear correlation is significantly weaker than that with in-domain data. Coupled with the MMLU case discussed in Appendix E  ###reference_###, these instances demonstrate that linear correlation relies on the alignment degree between the compression corpus and the specific area of study.\nHowever, we emphasize that our previous findings are relatively robust since our chosen compression corpora as listed in Table 1  ###reference_### rely on simple heuristics at a coarse granularity without meticulous designing.\nHow to automatically identify the most appropriate compression corpus that correlates with certain benchmarks is an important problem that we leave for future work.\nAs an example, we investigate the effect of size of compression corpus on the knowledge and commonsense ability.\nWe vary the number of characters of the compression corpus from 50K to 100M, observing changes in the Pearson correlation coefficient and the RMSE depicted in Figure 7  ###reference_###. As the number of sampled characters increases, the linear correlation gradually strengthens and reaches saturation at around 30M.\nThis observation suggests that the compression corpus is sufficiently large with only tens of millions of characters.\nWe further provide an analysis of the impact of random sampling on compression evaluation in Appendix C  ###reference_###.\n###figure_5### ###figure_6### ###figure_7### ###figure_8### ###figure_9### The previously discussed experiments focus exclusively on tasks related to a single ability. Nevertheless, numerous tasks require abilities in multiple aspects. For example, incorporating programming as an intermediate step for reasoning has been shown to enhance performance in mathematical tasks, requiring abilities in both coding and mathematical reasoning (Gao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b21###; Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b12###).

            "text": "In the previous experiments, we intentionally selected the appropriate compression corpora aligning with the area of focus. Herein, we further explore the effects of diverse compression corpora on the results. We investigate two representative examples where the compression corpus does not align with the specific domain, to study whether an arbitrary compression corpus would suffice for a strong linear correlation: (1) mathematical reasoning benchmarks v.s. compression on Common Crawl data, and (2) knowledge and commonsense benchmarks v.s. compression on GitHub code data. We present the findings in Figure 7  ###reference_###  ###reference_###.\nDue to a substantial ability mismatch between the compression corpus and the benchmarks, the linear correlation is significantly weaker than that with in-domain data. Coupled with the MMLU case discussed in Appendix E  ###reference_###  ###reference_###, these instances demonstrate that linear correlation relies on the alignment degree between the compression corpus and the specific area of study.\nHowever, we emphasize that our previous findings are relatively robust since our chosen compression corpora as listed in Table 1  ###reference_###  ###reference_### rely on simple heuristics at a coarse granularity without meticulous designing.\nHow to automatically identify the most appropriate compression corpus that correlates with certain benchmarks is an important problem that we leave for future work.\nAs an example, we investigate the effect of size of compression corpus on the knowledge and commonsense ability.\nWe vary the number of characters of the compression corpus from 50K to 100M, observing changes in the Pearson correlation coefficient and the RMSE depicted in Figure 7  ###reference_###  ###reference_###. As the number of sampled characters increases, the linear correlation gradually strengthens and reaches saturation at around 30M.\nThis observation suggests that the compression corpus is sufficiently large with only tens of millions of characters.\nWe further provide an analysis of the impact of random sampling on compression evaluation in Appendix C  ###reference_###  ###reference_###.\n###figure_14### ###figure_15### ###figure_16### ###figure_17### ###figure_18### The previously discussed experiments focus exclusively on tasks related to a single ability. Nevertheless, numerous tasks require abilities in multiple aspects. For example, incorporating programming as an intermediate step for reasoning has been shown to enhance performance in mathematical tasks, requiring abilities in both coding and mathematical reasoning (Gao et al., 2023b  ###reference_b21###  ###reference_b21###; Chen et al., 2023  ###reference_b12###  ###reference_b12###). Following  Gao et al. (2023b  ###reference_b21###  ###reference_b21###), we apply the Program-Aided Math Reasoning (PAL) method to GSM8K. To align with the abilities involved,we combined the Python and ArXiv-Math corpora to create a mixed corpus.

            "text": "Our findings provide evidence for the belief that superior compression is indicative of greater intelligence.\nPractically, our experiments strengthen the rationale to adopt compression efficiency as an unsupervised, flexible, and reliable metric to assess LLMs’ abilities.\nThe compression corpus can be easily updated and composed flexibly, which mitigates the data contamination and benchmark overfitting issues that most evaluations suffer from.\nWhile recent work establishes a large collection of diverse corpora to evaluate LLMs with losses (Magnusson et al., 2023  ###reference_b38###), our work offers strong empirical support for doing so by demonstrating the correlation with intelligence.\nOur study admits several limitations.\nFirst, we only focus on base models because fine-tuned models are not general-purpose compressors for arbitrary text. However, we posit that there are still interesting relationships to be explored about the base model compression efficiency and the benchmark scores of the corresponding fine-tuned models.\n Yuan et al. (2023  ###reference_b59###) initially provides evidence of this correlation in mathematical reasoning ability, albeit limited to LLaMA models.\nSecond,\nour focus lies on the short- to medium-context regimes, deferring the examination of long-context scenarios.\nThird, our conclusion and findings may only apply to well-trained models and not hold for LMs where the evaluated abilities have not emerged yet.\nWe leave study of these problems for future work."
