    "title": "Modeling Multimodal Social Interactions: New Challenges and Baselines with Densely Aligned Representations",
    "abstract": "Understanding social interactions involving both verbal and non-verbal cues is essential for effectively interpreting social situations. However, most prior works on multimodal social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. Consequently, they are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper, we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore, we propose a novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with densely aligned multimodal representations in modeling fine-grained social interactions.

            "text": "Real-world social interactions involve intricate behaviors between multiple people. People communicate not only through verbal cues (e.g., language) but also through non-verbal cues (e.g., gesture, gaze). While spoken language conveys explicit meaning, inferring the full social context from language alone can sometimes be ambiguous. Non-verbal cues can often play a crucial role in clarifying these subtle social nuances and providing additional context. Consequently, comprehensively understanding social interactions involving multimodal social cues is essential to interpret social situations appropriately.\n\n###figure_1### There have been attempts to investigate social behaviors in multimodal aspects by jointly considering language and visual cues. Some works tried to learn the relationships between spoken language and visual gestures for gesture generation [1  ###reference_b1###, 32  ###reference_b32###, 2  ###reference_b2###] and gesture-language grounding [29  ###reference_b29###]. Other multimodal approaches utilized the interconnection between spoken language and visual expressions to recognize human sentiment and emotion [55  ###reference_b55###, 43  ###reference_b43###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 39  ###reference_b39###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 9  ###reference_b9###]. However, these works mainly focus on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations in multi-party settings, rather than modeling the fine-grained dynamics of social interactions among multiple people. Modeling such intricate multi-party dynamics requires understanding the relationships between language and visual cues at an individual level, rather than using global representations.\nRecently, a multimodal work [28  ###reference_b28###] addressed social behaviors in social deduction games, which provide an effective testbed for studying multimodal social interactions. In these games, players take on roles and attempt to deduce the roles of their opponents by engaging in communication, deception, inference, and collaboration. These games encompass rich social interactions including verbal and non-verbal cues in multi-party settings. Lai et al. [28  ###reference_b28###] leveraged language and visual cues to predict persuasion strategies at the utterance level. However, their work has limitations in modeling multi-party interactions in terms of its task and methodology. Although persuasion strategies emerge in communication, the task primarily focuses on understanding the social behaviors of a single person rather than the dynamics among people. Moreover, their approach is limited in distinguishing and recognizing fine-grained interactions because it utilizes holistic visual representations for the entire scene, despite the presence of multiple people.\n\n###figure_2### To address these issues, we introduce three new multimodal tasks that encompass the dynamics of multi-party interactions, along with a novel baseline model. We extend the social deduction game datasets [28  ###reference_b28###] with extensive data annotations to curate new social tasks focused on identifying referents in multi-party conversations. Appropriately identifying referents is important because it significantly affects interpreting the social intent and context of conversations. Figure 1  ###reference_### shows the overall concepts of our curated social tasks. The three tasks are as follows.\nSpeaking target identification: Identifying who a speaker is talking to in a conversation.\nPronoun coreference resolution: Determining who a pronoun refers to in a conversation.\nMentioned player prediction: Predicting who is mentioned by name in a conversation.\nThese tasks are challenging as they require understanding the fine-grained dynamics of player interactions. For instance, when an utterance is accompanied by visual cues like pointing gestures, it is necessary to comprehensively interpret the utterance content and the speaker’s gestures for holistic reasoning. To this end, we need to figure out who the speaker is and who is being pointed at within the visual scene based on the utterance context. This involves matching utterances with the visually identified individuals. Thus, it is required to align language references with player visuals and to derive densely aligned multimodal representations from such aligned features. Figure 2  ###reference_### shows the concept of densely aligned language-visual representations.\nTo this end, we propose a novel baseline model leveraging densely aligned language-visual representations. We detect and visually track each player in the video to distinguish individual players. By initially aligning player visual positions with their language references, we continuously track player visuals in sync with the dialogue. This alignment allows the model to visually identify the speaker and the other players (i.e., listeners) for given utterances. Encoding speaker gestures and the relative positions of the listeners enables deciphering visual relationships for understanding non-verbal dynamics. We then combine this with the linguistic context of the conversation to obtain densely aligned representations. Consequently, we can effectively predict referents by leveraging densely aligned representations containing both verbal and non-verbal dynamics.\nThe major contributions of this paper are as follows.\nWe introduce new social tasks in multi-party settings via extensive data annotations: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction. These tasks are challenging as they require understanding the fine-grained dynamics of interactions.\nWe propose a novel multimodal baseline model leveraging language and visual cues for understanding multi-party social interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the multimodal dense alignment between language and visual social cues."

            "text": "Analyzing social behaviors has been widely investigated in the fields of digital forensics and natural language processing. Various works have focused primarily on analyzing social behaviors from a single-modal perspective. In terms of visual cues, some works proposed gaze target estimation techniques [11  ###reference_b11###, 18  ###reference_b18###, 27  ###reference_b27###, 49  ###reference_b49###, 48  ###reference_b48###] to analyze where a person is looking within a scene. There have also been studies that recognize social gaze patterns between multiple people such as identifying shared attention [20  ###reference_b20###, 16  ###reference_b16###, 46  ###reference_b46###, 36  ###reference_b36###]. Gesture recognition approaches [56  ###reference_b56###, 31  ###reference_b31###, 58  ###reference_b58###, 30  ###reference_b30###, 3  ###reference_b3###] have been researched to identify specific types of human gestures such as shaking hands and thumbs-up. Regarding language cues, dialogue act recognition methods [47  ###reference_b47###, 51  ###reference_b51###, 40  ###reference_b40###, 41  ###reference_b41###, 8  ###reference_b8###, 34  ###reference_b34###] have been introduced to understand the communicative intent behind utterances in social dialogues. Furthermore, there have been works on sentiment analysis and emotion recognition based on dialogue language [23  ###reference_b23###, 4  ###reference_b4###, 45  ###reference_b45###, 59  ###reference_b59###, 57  ###reference_b57###].\nRecently, joint modeling of visual and language modalities has been studied for social behavior analysis. Some works focused on learning the relationships between spoken language and gestures for gesture generation [1  ###reference_b1###, 32  ###reference_b32###, 2  ###reference_b2###] and gesture-language grounding [29  ###reference_b29###]. Liu et al. [32  ###reference_b32###] proposed a multimodal model that integrates visual, language, and speech cues via hierarchical manners to synthesize naturalistic gestures. Additionally, the intersection of spoken utterances and visual expressions has been explored for sentiment analysis and emotion recognition [55  ###reference_b55###, 43  ###reference_b43###, 22  ###reference_b22###, 39  ###reference_b39###, 21  ###reference_b21###, 9  ###reference_b9###]. Hu et al. [22  ###reference_b22###] proposed a unified feature space to capture the knowledge of sentiment and emotion comprehensively from multimodal cues. There have also been multimodal works for question & answering in social contexts [54  ###reference_b54###, 53  ###reference_b53###, 37  ###reference_b37###].\nHowever, these works mainly focus on the behaviors of a single person or rely on holistic visual features that are not densely aligned to language in multi-party environments. They are unable to model the complex dynamics of interactions, which requires understanding the spatial relationships of multiple people in addition to their utterances. We propose a novel approach leveraging densely aligned language-visual representations to capture the fine-grained dynamics."

Some prior studies have focused on developing game-playing agents and analyzing optimal strategies using game theory [6  ###reference_b6###, 35  ###reference_b35###, 5  ###reference_b5###, 44  ###reference_b44###, 12  ###reference_b12###]. These works aim to model the state of the game computationally but do not address understanding the dialogue and behaviors of players. Chittaranjan et al. [10  ###reference_b10###] modeled game outcomes from communication patterns such as player speaking and interrupting behaviors. Bakhtin et al. [14  ###reference_b14###] built an agent that can play diplomacy games by utilizing language models with strategic reasoning. These approaches do not capture verbal and non-verbal multimodal aspects of modeling social behaviors. Analyzing social behaviors has been rarely investigated in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, Lai et al. [28  ###reference_b28###] addressed social behaviors in social deduction games using multimodal representations. They leveraged language and visual cues to predict persuasion strategies at the utterance level such as identity declaration and interrogation.\nHowever, this multimodal work is limited in addressing multi-party dynamics due to the lack of person-level feature recognition. To address this gap, we introduce new tasks in social deduction games that explicitly demand recognizing person-level features. We also propose the corresponding baseline model that captures the multi-party dynamics across both language and visual representations."

Annotators reference both transcripts and videos comprehensively to make their annotations in the transcripts. To achieve reliable annotation quality, we initially request three annotators to label subsets of data and measure their annotation agreement using Krippendorff’s alpha [26  ###reference_b26###]. After we train the annotators sufficiently with  larger than 0.8, we request the three annotators to label independently for the rest of the data. Note that Krippendorff’s alpha  0.8 is generally considered to indicate good reliability with a high level of agreement [7  ###reference_b7###].\nTable 1  ###reference_### shows the summary of our data annotation results. We achieve sufficiently high  for both speaking target identification and pronoun coreference resolution. Note that we could obtain the annotations for the mentioned player prediction automatically. In the training and testing process, we anonymize all names in transcripts (e.g., [“David”, “Alice”, “Thomas”]  [“Player1”, “Player2”, “Player3”]). For each task, a test set is constructed using about 20% of the annotations. We split the training and test sets at the video level rather than at the individual utterance level to ensure no overlap in terms of contextual utterances. Annotation details for each task are as follows.\nTask1: Speaking target identification. This task aims to predict who a speaker is talking to in a dialogue. To this end, we annotate the labels of who a speaker is speaking to at the utterance level. Since utterances are often directed to all players, we perform the annotation only on the utterances that include [“you”, “your”]. We give our annotators three labeling options: (To Player#), (To Everyone), and (To Unknown). Based on the annotations, we add “(To [MASK])” at the end of a target utterance.\nTask2: Pronoun coreference resolution. This task aims to predict who a pronoun refers to in a dialogue. We conduct the annotation on the third-person pronouns that are used in our dataset, which are [“he”, “she”, “him”, “her”, “his”] in utterances. We give two options to annotators: [Player#] and [Unknown]. We only target the pronouns that indicate a specific player in the game. In terms of modeling the task, we change a pronoun to [MASK] in a target utterance.\nTask3: Mentioned player prediction. This task aims to predict who is referred to by their name in a dialogue. Since we know the ground truth names in utterances, it is possible to annotate these mentioned player labels automatically. We modify a mentioned player name with [MASK] in utterances and predict who is referred to in that part."

We utilize BERT as the language model for this experiment. As shown in the figure, our multimodal baseline leveraging both language and visual cues in a dense alignment manner can correct the inference when the language model alone fails. The qualitative results show that visual features aligned to utterances provide complementary information to disambiguate referents in social interactions."

            "text": "We introduce three new challenging tasks in social deduction games: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction - all of which require understanding the fine-grained verbal and non-verbal dynamics between multiple people. We curate extensive dataset annotations for our new social tasks and further propose a novel multimodal baseline that establishes dense language-visual alignments between spoken utterances and player visual features. This approach enables modeling multi-party social interactions through verbal and non-verbal communication channels simultaneously. Experiments show consistent and considerable performance improvements of our multimodal baselines over other approaches without both modalities and without multimodal dense alignment. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our baseline components. We release the benchmarks and source code to facilitate further research in this direction.\nAcknowledgement.\nPortions of this project were supported in part by a gift from Meta."
