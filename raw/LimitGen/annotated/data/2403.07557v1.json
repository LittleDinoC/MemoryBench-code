    "title": "SIFiD: Reassess Summary Factual Inconsistency Detection with LLM",
    "abstract": "Ensuring factual consistency between the summary and the original document is paramount in summarization tasks. Consequently, considerable effort has been dedicated to detecting inconsistencies. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have begun to leverage their advanced language understanding capabilities for inconsistency detection. However, early attempts have shown that LLMs underperform traditional models due to their limited ability to follow instructions and the absence of an effective detection methodology. In this study, we reassess summary inconsistency detection with LLMs, comparing the performances of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. To advance research in LLM-based inconsistency detection, we propose SIFiD (Summary Inconsistency Detection with Filtered Document) that identify key sentences within documents by either employing natural language inference or measuring semantic similarity between summaries and documents.",

            "text": "Document summarization, the process of distilling key information from extensive texts, has become indispensable across various real-world applications, propelled by advancements in Natural Language Generation (NLG) Pilault et al. (2020  ###reference_b11###); Ma et al. (2022  ###reference_b9###). The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) Brown et al. (2020  ###reference_b1###); Ouyang et al. (2022  ###reference_b10###); Touvron et al. (2023  ###reference_b14###) has notably enhanced models’ capabilities to generate natural and factually consistent summaries Chang et al. (2023  ###reference_b2###). However, the rapid evolution in summarization techniques may lead to factually inconsistent summaries which are very close to facts Zhang et al. (2023  ###reference_b16###). Such inconsistencies could pose significant challenges, resulting in hallucinations that traditional detection models struggle to identify. As LLMs evolve, there is a critical demand for more robust methods to detect factual inconsistencies, leveraging the advanced capabilities of LLMs themselves.\nLuo et al. (2023  ###reference_b8###) were among the first to utilize LLMs for the detection of factual inconsistencies, employing a universal zero-shot prompt across various benchmarks in SummaC Laban et al. (2022  ###reference_b7###) and inputting the full document along with its summary into GPT-3.5 for evaluation. Despite these innovations, their approach was limited by the plain application, early GPT-3.5 model’s constraints and a lack of adaptation to the specific requirements of different benchmarks. Consequently, their method did not achieve superior performance compared to existing models, such as those detailed in the SummaC paper.\nThis paper revisits the challenge of inconsistency detection in document summarization through zero-shot inference with LLMs, specifically examining the latest versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the SummaC dataset. We aim to set up new LLM-based baselines for research in this domain. Moreover, we introduce a novel methodology, SIFiD (Summary Inconsistency Detection with Filtered Document), designed to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of factual inconsistency detection. SIFiD focuses on identifying crucial sentences within documents by evaluating their entailment scores or semantic similarity with summary sentences, subsequently retaining only the most relevant sentences for further analysis. This approach not only refines the assessment of factual consistency but also reduces the computational resources required for evaluation by decreasing the number of input tokens.\n###figure_1### Our comprehensive evaluation on the SummaC dataset reveals that, while the updated GPT-3.5 model still falls short of outperforming traditional baseline methods, GPT-4 significantly excels in detecting factual inconsistencies. The integration of SIFiD further amplifies GPT-4’s detection capabilities, highlighting the potency of our proposed method. To support continued research and collaboration in this field, we make our code available open source at Anonymous, fostering advancements and exploration in factual inconsistency detection."

            "text": "The evaluation of summary factual consistency has traditionally relied on methods such as Question Answering and Question Generation (QAG) Wang et al. (2020  ###reference_b15###); Durmus et al. (2020  ###reference_b3###); Scialom et al. (2021  ###reference_b13###), synthetic classifiers Kryściński et al.

These methodologies focus on identifying discrepancies between documents and their summaries. Laban et al. (2022  ###reference_b7###) later demonstrated that Natural Language Inference (NLI) could be effectively employed for inconsistency detection at appropriate levels of text granularity, thereby advancing the field of summary inconsistency detection.\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently shifted the focus towards integrating these models into the assessment of summary factual consistency. Luo et al. (2023  ###reference_b8###) pioneered the application of GPT-3.5 for this purpose, tailoring prompts to various evaluation tasks including summary factual inconsistency detection, summary ranking, and consistency evaluation. Despite this innovative approach, the early iteration of GPT-3.5, coupled with an insufficient detection methodology, did not yield improvements over conventional techniques in identifying factual inconsistencies.\nIn our research, we revisit the approach proposed by Luo et al. (2023  ###reference_b8###), employing the most recent versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We integrate these advanced LLMs with our newly developed Summary Inconsistency Detection with Filtered Document (SIFiD) method. This combination aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of factual inconsistency detection, leveraging the state-of-the-art capabilities of LLMs to set new benchmarks in the field."

            "text": "As underscored in the Introduction, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting summary factual inconsistencies is crucial to addressing the challenges posed by rapidly improving document summarization capabilities. While Luo et al. (2023  ###reference_b8###) were pioneers in utilizing LLMs for this task, their methodology was constrained by the plain application, the limitations of early GPT models and a lack of differentiation in benchmark requirements. Our objective is to reevaluate this detection process using the most recent GPT models and a refined prompt template for the Polytope benchmark.\nInitially, we applied the prompt template used by Luo et al. (2023  ###reference_b8###) to assess the performance of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo on SummaC. Recognizing the distinct requirements of Polytope benchmark in SummaC, we crafted a tailored prompt template to better suit Polytope and reevaluated the models’ performance. The revised prompt template is detailed below:\nDecide if the following summary have any of the specified problems in relation to the corresponding article.\nThe problems are categorized as omission, addition, or inaccuracy. Omission means Key point is missing from the summary. Addition means Unnecessary and irrelevant snippets from the Article are included in the summary. Inaccuracy means some information in the summary is not supported by the article.\nArticle:\n{{ Article }}\nSummary:\n{{ Summary }}\nIf the summary has any of the above problems, answer ’No’. Otherwise, answer ’Yes’. Answer (Yes or No):\nComparing with the original prompt, we let the model detect omission, addition, and inaccuracy summary to fit the annotation of Polytope. With the experiments above, we set a new baseline for summary factual inconsistency detection with LLMs."

The net entailment score is calculated by , where  and  are the initial entailment score and contradiction score directly calculated by the NLI model on . The net entailment score reflects the degree to which the summary sentence is supported by the document sentence without contradiction.\nSemantic Similarity Scorer: For assessing semantic similarity, we leverage the sentence-transformers library to generate embeddings for both document and summary sentences, denoted as  and , respectively. The cosine similarity between these embeddings serves as the measure of semantic similarity, which is , where  quantifies the semantic closeness between the document and summary sentences. This metric enables us to identify and assess the degree of semantic overlap."

            "text": "The experimental outcomes are summarized in Table 1  ###reference_###, leading to several insights on LLM-based summary factual inconsistency detection:\nPrefer GPT-4 Over GPT-3.5. Analysis indicates that previous LLM-based methods, though superior to many traditional techniques, underperform compared to SummaC-Conv. This discrepancy is attributed to the limited capabilities of the GPT-3.5 model. Our reevaluation with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model yielded results similar to those of Luo et al. (2023  ###reference_b8###). However, substituting GPT-3.5 with GPT-4 Turbo significantly enhanced performance, from 69.7 to 78.0, underscoring GPT-4’s advanced language comprehension.\nAdopt Benchmark-Specific Prompt Templates. The effectiveness of a single prompt template across different benchmarks is limited due to the unique requirements of each benchmark. Traditional methods typically incorporate benchmark-specific training, which mitigates task variance. In contrast, LLMs rely on the provided instructions, necessitating tailored prompt templates. Adjusting the prompt template for Polytope increased GPT-4’s performance from 60.9 to 66.0, elevating the overall average to 78.8. However, this adjustment resulted in a performance decline for GPT-3.5 on Polytope, from 57.9 to 41.0, highlighting GPT-3.5’s inferior prompt comprehension.\nEnhanced Performance with SIFiD on GPT-4. Integrating SIFiD with GPT-4 further improved its performance to 79.9. SIFiD’s selective filtering of sentences enhances document relevance to the summary, simplifying factual inconsistency detection. This approach did not yield similar benefits for GPT-3.5, possibly due to its reduced efficacy in processing less fluent filtered documents.\nMixed Results with Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Applying CoT techniques did not uniformly benefit all methods. While GPT-3.5 saw improvements, GPT-4’s performance declined, suggesting GPT-4’s innate proficiency in inconsistency detection without CoT. Additionally, CoT might introduce biases that could negatively influence outcomes."
