    "title": "Cross-Language Evolution of Divergent Collective Memory Around the Arab Spring",
    "abstract": "The Arab Spring was a historic set of protests beginning in 2011 that toppled governments and led to major conflicts. Collective memories of events like these can vary significantly across social contexts in response to political, cultural, and linguistic factors. While Wikipedia plays an important role in documenting both historic and current events, little attention has been given to how Wikipedia articles, created in the aftermath of major events, continue to evolve over years or decades. Using the archived content of Arab Spring-related topics across the Arabic and English Wikipedias between 2011 and 2024,\nwe define and evaluate multilingual measures of event salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory surrounding the Arab Spring. Our findings about the temporal evolution of the Wikipedia articles’ content similarity across languages has implications for theorizing about online collective memory processes and evaluating linguistic models trained on these data.",

            "text": "Collective memory is the communal act of sense-making that results in community based perspectives of the past (Halbwachs 1992  ###reference_b10###; Zubrzycki and Woźny 2020  ###reference_b27###). It is difficult to study empirically across linguistic and cultural contexts due to diverse evidence and sense-making processes. Wikipedia has become a test case, a “global memory place”, to understand and compare the emergence and evolution of collective memory processes (Pentzold 2009  ###reference_b21###; Yasseri, Gildersleve, and David 2022  ###reference_b26###). As a test case, the Arab Spring is major demonstration of internet mediated collective action that spanned across linguistic barriers and has become a salient case study to understand collective memory on Wikipedia (Ferron and Massa 2011a  ###reference_b5###, b  ###reference_b6###; Al-Shehari and Al-Sharafi 2022  ###reference_b2###)\nThere are no requirements that different Wikipedia language editions have identical or even similar content about a topic. Because the content of each edit made to Wikipedia articles are stored in revision histories that can be retrieved and analyzed, it is possible to retrieve and compare across historical versions of articles. Researchers can leverage this temporal variation in article content within and across languages to identify the emergence of consensus perspectives, conflicts, and other processes associated with the construction and contestation of collective memory processes (Ford 2022  ###reference_b8###). This paper examines the construction of collective memory on Arabic and English Wikipedia articles about the events related to the 2011 Arab Spring by focusing on the use of two types of links within articles. The first type of links are “outlinks” from one article to another (also known as “blue links”) that are strong signals of similarity between articles based on editors’ judgments of relevance and context.111https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual˙of˙Style/Linking\nThe second type of links are inter-lingual links (ILL) identifying similar topics in other language editions.222https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage˙links\nThis paper compares these links between articles across languages to detect what is introduced (or removed) and when as proxies for collective memory processes.\nThis paper contributes to two related empirical literatures using Wikipedia data. The first contribution is the study of different Wikipedia language editions by comparing their structure (Porter, Krafft, and Keegan 2020  ###reference_b22###; Hickman et al. 2021  ###reference_b15###; Adar, Skinner, and Weld 2009  ###reference_b1###; He et al. 2018  ###reference_b12###; Dandala, Mihalcea, and Bunescu 2012  ###reference_b4###), content (Hecht and Gergle 2010  ###reference_b14###; Roy, Bhatia, and Jain 2022  ###reference_b24###; Massa and Scrinzi 2012  ###reference_b20###), and collaboration practices like deliberation (Hale 2014  ###reference_b11###). This literature is often focused on macroscopic patterns involving the entire project and comparisons at a particular point in time instead of more situated cases or the evolution of content. The second contribution uses Wikipedia data to understand collective memory processes (Twyman, Keegan, and Shaw 2017  ###reference_b25###; Luyt 2016  ###reference_b19###; Ferron and Massa 2014  ###reference_b7###). This literature is often focused on the collaborations and content in the days and weeks immediately following major events rather than collective memory processes that may unfold over years or decades. To address each of these limitations, we focus on a sample of articles related to the events of the 2011 Arab Spring that unfolded over 13 years ago to characterize and compare the “afterlives” of content about major historical events.\nThis paper presents an ensemble of quantitative methods to develop a grounded understanding of four behaviors related to collective memory formation: salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation.\nThe Arab Spring is what revolutionized our understanding of contemporary collective action. Our more complex definition of collective memory analyzing the Arab Spring summary page in English and Arabic, will allow a more thorough understanding of the entire collective memory process that is presented on Wikipedia.\nTo analyze the salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory around the Arab Spring we identified four questions to motivate our work:\nIs the concept salient through the time period in question, pointing to a continuing collective memory process?\nThrough analysis of size and number of outlinks, we find that the Arab Spring is a salient across languages from 2011 until early 2024 (present).\nAre results of varying deliberation processes across languages, creating divergent perspectives on the Wikipedia articles?\nBy clustering outlinks by their temporal inclusion, we find there are varying deliberation processes that are highlighted through previously latent inclusion themes we label, ’Stable’, ’Debated’, and ’Forgotten’.\nHow similar are the outlinks contextualizing the event across languages over time?\nLeveraging the ILLs of outlinks, we see that not only are the outlinks available across languages is different but that the majority of outlinks that are included post-phenomenon are isolated within each linguistic version of this article.\nWhen do articles about related concepts link to the Arab Spring article, consolidating it within a broader context?\nAnalysis of Ego-networks shows that in English articles about countries that are involved with the Arab Spring include reference to the Arab Spring but they do not in Arabic. Both languages debate the reflective reference to the phenomenon page when broken down into individual events within the Arab Spring.\n###figure_1### ###figure_2###"

Within the context of Wikipedia, if a article has been neglected with little to no additions or changes, we assume the collective memory surrounding the topic to be settled and solidified within that linguistic community. To understand if the Arab Spring article is still salient, we looked at the size and number of outlinks within the article over time. Both of these attributes are simple measurements to identify continual efforts by editors to update and upkeep the article within contemporary contexts, possibly altering the way in which the Arab Spring is being remembered.

Both articles continue to change over time, point to an active editor group, constantly re-contextualizing the article. However, upon further analysis we realize that the size of the article is also heavily influenced by the editing of external references333External references refer to links to websites outside of Wikipedia, predominantly seen in sources.\nIn the English Arab Spring summary article the size has large variations at certain points in time. The large drop in 2012, was due to the transition of this article into a summary page as the outlinks were deleted from here and moved to the article about ‘concurrent incidents’. The next drop in 2016, as mentioned was due to an edit of references, but was influenced also by a restructuring of the ‘Social Media and the Arab Spring’ sub-section of the article. The size then started to rise a few months later from its local minimum, by editors adding to ’Aftermath’ and ’Social Media’ subsections of the article. Then in the beginning of 2017 a bot ‘fixed 198 sources’ largely increasing the size. The last large change in size was due to an individual editor, who in 2019 came in and restructured most of the page, adding or altering 5 sub sections of the article. These large changes in size through time points to continued salience within the editor community as they maintain external links as well as update subsections particularly about social media and what happened after the Arab Spring.\nWith only two main increases in size the Arabic Arab Spring summary article, a picture of an article that has very little negotiation or updating after 2013 is presented. In 2013, an editor deleted interwiki links444Interwiki links can be a link to another project, to another language and both, to another project in another language. away the article similar to external links having a relatively large change in size. In 2018, a bot repaired external references that linked to web pages that no longer existed. Although there isn’t large variation in size like the English Arab Spring article, its consistent increase in size is due to editors continually making changes with edits even in 2023 such as,\n”الجملة فيها مقصد مستفز لبعض السوريين المؤيدين للحكومة السورية”\n(This sentence has a provocative meaning for some Syrian supporters of the Syrian government) resulting in a decrease of 19 bytes and \\RL”معلومات دون مصادر” (Information without sources, removing tags) resulting in an increase of 63 bytes, constantly re-adjusting small things but that is related to the collective memory process."

This provides additional information and context that is not available just looking at size.\nIn the English version of the Arab Spring Summary article, outside of the largest drop of outlinks in 2012, due to the restructuring resulting in the English Arab Spring summary page, single editors coming in and making large updates to the article are what influence the number of outlinks changing. For example, in 2016 two editors came in and restructured the ’Social Media and the Arab Spring’, ’International Pressures’ and ’Aftermath’ subsections of the article leading to the inverted plateau. The large increase in 2019 was the same single editor revision that caused an increase in size by altering 6 sub sections of the article that included, ’Results’, ’Aftermath’, ’Social Justice’, and ’Counter-revolution and Civil Wars’. In 2021, someone tried to redo the summary box and although it was immediately undone, and in 2022 an editor added 23 links to the Outcomes section but only caused the article to increase by 3 bytes in size and was shortly undone not long after\nIn the Arabic version of the article, the largest increase in number of outlinks was in February of 2012, someone did comprehensive overhaul of the introduction. There are two relatively small increases in October of 2015 where someone added more information about the events in Jordan and July of 2021 when a bot and a person both added information about Morocco. The last large increase was in March of 2023 where an individual editor make a large contribution over the whole month that he primarily tagged, \\RL تحرير مرئي  or ’Visual Editing’.\nThe continual changes in size across languages and through time points to continued salience within both editor communities as they maintain external links and update subsections, particularly about social media and what happened after the Arab Spring in English. Although through smaller changes in Arabic, the continual engagement of editors through time confirms our question 1: the Arab Spring has continued to be a salient topic within both the English and Arabic Wikipedia communities."

Although this is an intuitive look at the the sense-making process, the production resulting from these discussions is what broader members of the linguistic community will interact with. That is why we operationalize deliberation through temporal outlink inclusion and exclusion. Outlinks are built into the Wikipedia infrastructure as a way to help readers learn more about a topic that an editor deems relevant to understanding the topic at hand. Their inclusion in the article can be the result of the previously studied editor dynamics but their inclusion and exclusion over time also lends insight into changing perspectives because information on Wikipedia articles are constantly being deliberated as new people get exposed to the content, as we saw through our analysis of article salience.\nTo analyze these outlinks through temporal inclusion we implement one hot encoding and vectorize outlink inclusion for each revision version of the Arab Spring article. We clustered these concepts by their pairwise similarity scores to create a heatmap that positions words with similar scores closer together creating a more digestible heatmap. This resulting heatmap revealing the latent inclusion patterns of broader themes and topics."

This was due to an editor contemporarily re-contextualizing the article. This was done by altering sections about the aftermath, Yemen, Libya, and deleting a large description about Syria suggesting a move to the Syrian Civil War Wikipedia page.

They both are sub-groups of ’Forgotten’ concepts and both are a part of the active evolution of the Arab Spring phenomenon as everything in both clusters are removed by 2014. This is the outlink evolution that would be captured in previous literature that limits the temporal scope to the time of phenomenon activity.\nThe large spike in Cluster 4 happened in the month of March in 2011. These were all included that month and then by the end of March 2011 they were deleted. Previously included were topics about other countries outside of the Middle East are forgotten such as ”Chinese Communist Party”, ”Republic of Korea Armed Forces”, ”Socialist Party of Albania”, ”Uganda”, ”Zimbabqe” and ”South Sudan”. This is a very early time in the Arab Spring phenomenon. This cluster reveals discussions and decisions about what this page and phenomenon is supposed to be about and the resulting excluded topics. Many of the references to other countries were about events that were happening simultaneously. For example, in February and March there is mention of leaflets about the Arab Spring dropped in North Korea by the South Korean military. This was subsequently moved to a different article titled ’Impacts of the Arab Spring’.\nCluster 5 has a small decrease at the end of 2012 and completely minimized in 2014. This includes outlinks such as ”Cabinet of Yemen” and ”2011 Lebanese protests”. Where Cluster 4 referrs to concepts outside of the Middle East, this cluster points to ’Forgotten’ concepts within the Middle East, such as around Palestine (”Palestinian Intifada” ”Gaza Strip”), the Gulf (”Royal Oman Police”, ”United Arab Emirates”) and other concepts relevant to the region at the time such as ”Media Blackout”. This deletion was primarily due to an editor ”splitting the Arab Spring into concurrent incidents” where they deleted the concurrent incidents section of this article and put it into a different Wikipedia page. This is an interesting choice because it deleted specifics about countries such as ’Algeria’ but some details were still left in the overall page, included in descriptions of initial protests. This deletion further specifies what countries are considered ’officially’ within the Arab Spring."

There is actually no overlap between these two inclusion groups and those we label this cluster as both ’Forgotten’ and ’Debated’.

They are added in this section by an editor with a small description in June of 2021. Without a description this editor re-writes the descriptions of the events in Morocco, excluding its ties to other protests and focusing more on internal events.\nUnderstanding outlinks to reflect distinct deliberation processes, we identify a ’Stable’ inclusion of western concepts in the English version and contemporary conflicts in the Middle East in Arabic. ’Forgotten’ and forgotten concepts related to simultaneous events in the Middle East, Asia, and Northern Africa in both languages, similar to the English version pointed to a definition of the Arab Spring is and the events that it encompasses. ’Debated’ concepts within the editor and non-editor community in English that evolve as different editors get involved and contemporarily re-contextualize the phenomenon."

Table 1 shows that within both articles only around 25% and 30% of the ’Arab Spring’ outlinks reference concepts that are shared between language versions of the article. A majority of these are links to either major conflicts or people related to the phenomenon such as ”2011 Egyptian revolution”, ”Bashar al-Assad”, ”Muammar Gaddafi”, and ”Yemeni Revolution”. A majority of the 18 English articles with no Arabic equivalent are American individuals and concepts such as ”Zeynep Tufekci”, an American professor studying social media of Arab Spring. Outlinks that are only in Arabic, fall into two main categories: ’structure-based’ and ’content-based’. ’Structure-based’ outlinks are links such as, \\RLبوابة:الشرق الأوسط or ”Portal: Middle East”, and \\RLدستور تونس (توضيح) or ”Constitution of Tunisia (Disambiguation)”, are articles that are made because of the structure of Wikipedia where as ’content-based’ articles, in this subgroup are articles like \\RLالمبادرة الخليجية (Gulf Initiative), and \\RLمحاكمة حسني مبارك (Trial of Hosni Mubarak). These were made because people wanted to have articles about these topics. A majority of the articles that have articles in both languages but only referenced in the English version, continue the pattern of western concepts such as ”Condoleezza Rice” as well as concepts about political philosophy such as ”Authoritarianism” and ”Economic stagnation”. There are also additional outlinks to information across countries involved in the phenomenon. Such as, ”Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–2014)”, ”Yemeni Crisis (2011–present)”, and ”2012–2013 Egyptian protests”. There is a large infrastructure on Arabic Wikipedia of dates, and that is seen in the links that cross both languages but are only referenced in Arabic. For example, \\RLيناير 14 (January 14) links to an article that describes everything that happened that day; it is also a major day of protests in Tunisia, Lebanon, and Jordan. Other themes present in this section are topics about the Israel-Palestine conflict such as \\RLإسرائيل (Israel) and \\RLحرب 1948 (1948 War) which English equivalent article is ”1948 Arab–Israeli War” and outlinks themed around Government structures like \\RLمجلس النواب البحريني which English article is, ”Council of Representatives (Bahrain)”. As seen in English language Cluster 2 of Deliberation, the ’Stable’ outlinks are what culminate within the current version of the article. Both language articles shared foundational texts. There is a strong inclusion of western concepts and concepts about political philosophy isolated within the English version as well as available across languages but only referenced in English. Structural elements within the Arabic language edition of Wikipedia motivate the inclusion of certain outlinks but there are also many links that focus on Middle Eastern phenomena."

The number of shared outlinks between pages, is almost 50% of the outlinks in this article at a given time is in part due to the size, although it is so few articles since the Arabic article is significantly smaller, foundational outlinks take up more of the article proportionally. This produces a contextualization process that is not does not vary far off of the foundational concepts."

The consolidation of the Arab Spring as a fixture of this system would be its inclusion within the articles about the events and countries involved in the broader phenomenon. We identified eleven events888’2011 Omani protests’, ’2011–2012 Moroccan protests’, ’2011–2012 Jordanian protests’, ’2011 Iraqi protests’, ’2010–2012 Algerian protests’, ’2011 Bahraini uprising’, ’Syrian revolution’, ’Yemeni Revolution’, ’Libyan civil war (2011)’, ’2011 Egyptian revolution’, ’Tunisian Revolution’ that both the English and Arabic versions of the summary article deemed ‘important’ and the countries in which those events take place999These events and countries were cross referenced between languages and the only discrepancy is that in the English article, the event associated with Syria was the “Syrian Revolution” article which is not referenced in the Arabic article at all. Instead in the Arabic article, “The Syrian Civil War” page is referenced. Since that article is also referenced in the English article, that is the event we investigated..\nWe investigated this consolidation by generating country and event based ego networks101010A type of network from social network analysis that maps connections from a particular perspective\nfor monthly page revisions of the articles and their outlinks and measuring inclusion within those networks. The resulting figures do not present whether the ’Arab Spring’ article is mentioned but whether editors consider the ’Arab Spring; summary article a necessary and relevant point of information to contextualize the country or event.\n###figure_10### ###figure_11### Figure7(a) is a visual representation of the inclusion of the “Arab Spring” as an outlink within the English language country articles. The English language country articles appear to only have slight deliberation about the inclusion of the ’Arab Spring’ in the articles. In 2014, all but one of the country’s Wikipedia articles referenced the Arab Spring as an outlink in their article. This has a stark contrast to the English language event articles in Figure 7(b)that show debate about the inclusion of the ’Arab Spring’ summary page.\nThe ’Arab Spring’ appears to consolidate the most within the Libyan, Bahraini, and Yemeni context with both the country and event having the most inclusion through time. These events have quite different resolutions with events in Bahrain ending in 2018 and events that were triggered by the ’Arab Spring’ creating diverting contemporary problems in Libya and Yemen.\nThe Iraqi, Egyptian, and Omani articles have the lowest inclusion in both their event and country articles. This points to a delayed connection between to ’Arab Spring’ and could point to a distinction between the Arab Spring and those events. Alternatively it could be so tied to the concept of the Arab Spring, an additional reference wouldn’t be necessary.\nThere is a discrepancy between the ’Syria’ article including the ’Arab Spring’ consistently from the beginning and the Syrian event not beginning to include or negotiate its inclusion until after 2013. Within English Wikipedia, editors found the Arab Spring a defining characteristic of countries across the MENA111111Middle East and North Africa region and debate over phenomenon level referencing.\n###figure_12### ###figure_13### The Arabic language country and event articles debate the inclusion of the Arab Spring from the beginning, as shown in Figure 8.\nThe ’Libya’ article and ’Iraq’ article never include the ’Arab Spring’ and the ’Egypt; article only includes it for 2 or 3 months at a time; so rarely that it did not show on our visual. Arabic editors did not find linking the ’Arab Spring’ to be a necessary contextualization of these countries. ’Jordan’ and ’Bahrain’, articles about two countries that had relatively smaller events, consolidate the Arab Spring as context in their Wikipedia articles through the most time. ’Morocco’ and ’Oman’ have larger debates and then only as of 2021 include the outlink.\nThe Syrian country article and event includes the Arab Spring through the longest amount of time but even this article in 2020 began debating its inclusion.\nOpposing the English language community on Wikipedia, the Arabic language community found it hardly necessary to link the Arab Spring article in adjacent articles.\nThere is a strong consolidation of the Arab Spring within the English country Wikipedia country articles but a majority of other articles analyzed across languages heavily debated the Arab Spring as necessary contextualization pointing to a varying consolidation within collective memory processes on Wikipedia and across languages."

            "text": "How do collective memory processes unfold differently across different Wikipedia language editions? Previous research has looked at collective memory processes or compared content across language editions, but this paper provides novel empirical findings about both of these components. We proposed an ensemble of quantitative constructs for measuring four distinct collective memory processes identified in memory studies: salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation. We evaluated these processes using a research design combining variation over time and across languages for articles related to the 2011 Arab Spring.\nSalience was operationalized as a measure of the size and number of outlinks. The English article surprisingly shows greater variation in size and content over time than the Arabic article, following patterns similar to punctuated equilibria: periods of stability interrupted by sudden changes. In contrast, the Arabic article is both shorter and more stable. Deliberation was operationalized as similarity in the temporal vectors of outlink occurrence. The English article had five distinctive clusters of behavior relating to outlink inclusion that we classified as “stable”, “debated”, and “forgotten” interpretations while the Arabic article had only two clusters. Contextualization was operationalized as a measure of overlap in the inter-language link graph. Despite the availability of relevant topics across languages, the Arabic and English articles referenced very different concepts. Finally, consolidation was operationalized as references to the Arab Spring article in the articles about countries and their national-level protests. The Arabic Spring article is linked much less in Arabic articles for countries and events than in English.\nThese results highlighting disparities in the content and dynamics about the Arab Spring reinforce prior findings about the differences in coverage about the same topics across Wikipedia’s language editions. The greater salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation on the English compared to the Arabic article for these major events is a surprising counterpoint to the “self-focus bias” found in other multilingual analyses (Hecht and Gergle 2009  ###reference_b13###, 2010  ###reference_b14###). The English article employs links reflecting Western cultural biases about history and politics that do not appear in the the Arabic version that provides its own distinctive contexts. Despite the greater geographic and cultural proximity of the events of the Arab Spring to Arabic speakers, the English-language article has far greater dynamism in its content and relationships than the Arabic-language article. The comparative absence of links to the \\RLالربيع العربي (“Arab Spring”) article across Arabic-language articles about national histories and even national events (Figure 7  ###reference_### is particularly surprising."

            "text": "The Arabic and English Wikipedias’ coverage of the Arab Spring are structured by distinct collective memory practices. We developed an ensemble of generalizable quantitative methods grounded in definitions from memory studies to enable comparisons of collective memory processes across languages and over time. These methods could be extended to other cases to examine whether these processes on the English Wikipedia are reliably distinctive because of its size and influence or if other language editions with similar cultural proximity to these events (Farsi, Hebrew, Turkish, etc.) exhibit similarities to each other rather than to an outlier like English. Similarly, alternative constructs for collective memory processes and their empirical operationalizations might identify greater similarities or stronger differences.\nThese findings also contribute revisiting theories and methods for understanding collective memory processes. The concept of collective memory has been criticized from historiographical and cultural studies perspectives for reproducing dominant or revisionist historical narratives over alternative interpretations and marginalized perspectives (Confino 1997  ###reference_b3###; Kansteiner 2002  ###reference_b16###). Wikipedia’s rules governing citations emphasize the use of reliable sources which may similarly privilege some framings and interpretations over others. Although major contemporary historical events like the Arab Spring should attract more representative cross-sections of editorial perspectives, Wikipedia is not immune from motivated editors “capturing” pages to enforce specific narratives (Grabowski and Klein 2023  ###reference_b9###; Kharazian, Starbird, and Hill 2023  ###reference_b18###). Future work should examine whether the “afterlives” of articles documenting major historical events are prone to capture or unreliable narratives because of declining editorial attention.\nOur research design did not analyze the structure, dynamics, or content of discussions that accompanied the collaborations generating these articles. English and Arabic are each global languages with colonial legacies that do not map as cleanly to national boundaries as languages like Swedish, Hindi, or Japanese, for example. Collective memory cases drawn from those context may exhibit stronger self-focus biases than we saw with Arabic and English. Mechanisms like overlaps among contributors across articles and languages, conflicts over content, and processes for resolving disputes and forming consensus could have influenced the decisions to include or remove links over time we observed. A closer analysis of the content, discussions, and editors’ activity could provide a richer description of additional forces shaping the content including and beyond outlinks on these articles.\nThe clustering of outlinks based on similarities in their temporal inclusion ignores other constructs for measuring the similarity of links and articles over time. Word embeddings trained on the content of out-linked articles, coauthorship patterns of contributing editors, or similarities in the pageview activity could all provide additional context and counterfactuals for the patterns of the observed temporal clustering. Understanding how outlink temporal inclusion vectors align with these other measures of similarity could have implications for large language and other natural language models trained on Wikipedia data. Because different language editions encode different content, content differences could be mistakenly equated and the resulting biases amplified. Characterizing the (mis)alignments across languages and over time is an important for identifying and preventing misalignments."
