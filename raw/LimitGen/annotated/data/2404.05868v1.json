LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model’s utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse—a drastic degradation of the model’s utilities.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs), pretrained on massive corpora of internet data, possess the capability to memorize portions of their training data (Carlini et al., 2021  ###reference_b4###, 2022  ###reference_b5###). However, this capability raises significant concerns, as the training data may contain sensitive or private information, potentially leading to societal challenges. For instance, language models could breach individual privacy by outputting personal information such as social security numbers from the memorized data (Carlini et al., 2021  ###reference_b4###; Huang et al., 2022  ###reference_b14###). They might also violate copyright by generating text from memorized books, such as the Harry Potter novels (Eldan & Russinovich, 2023  ###reference_b9###). Furthermore, LLM assistants for biology could inadvertently aid in the development of biological weapons by troubleshooting bottlenecks, increasing the risk of such attempts (Sandbrink, 2023  ###reference_b33###; Li et al., 2024  ###reference_b19###). In response to these concerns, regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Mantelero, 2013  ###reference_b25###; Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017  ###reference_b40###) and the US’s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (CCPA, 2018  ###reference_b6###) have mandated the Right to be Forgotten, requiring applications to support the deletion of information contained in training samples upon user requests. This has motivated a line of research on machine unlearning, aiming to address these challenges.\nMachine unlearning (Cao & Yang, 2015  ###reference_b3###; Bourtoule et al., 2021  ###reference_b2###) aims to delete the influence of specific training samples from machine-learning models while preserving other knowledge and capabilities (Liu et al., 2024a  ###reference_b21###; Zhang et al., 2023  ###reference_b45###; Nguyen et al., 2022  ###reference_b28###; Xu et al., 2023  ###reference_b42###; Si et al., 2023  ###reference_b36###). Notably, a straightforward approach to unlearning is to retrain a language model from scratch. However, as retraining from scratch is typically computationally expensive, cheaper methods for removing undesirable information is highly desirable. Recently, several works (Jang et al., 2022  ###reference_b16###; Wang et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###; Chen & Yang, 2023  ###reference_b7###; Yao et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023  ###reference_b9###; Yao et al., 2024  ###reference_b43###; Liu et al., 2024b  ###reference_b22###; Li et al., 2024  ###reference_b19###) proposed scalable and practical techniques for unlearning LLMs through directly fine-tuning the trained model. Core to many of these works is a gradient ascent procedure on the prediction loss over the dataset to be unlearned (i.e., the forget set), building on the intuition that gradient ascent is an approximation of “reverting” gradient descent optimization.\n###figure_1### Despite its simplicity and widespread use, the performance of gradient ascent based approaches remain unsatisfactory. A notable example concerns the recently released benchmark dataset TOFU (Maini et al., 2024  ###reference_b24###), which consists of synthetically generated biographies of 200 fictitious authors, and the task is to unlearn the biographies of 1%, 5%, and 10% of the 200 authors from a model that is already fine-tuned on all 200 authors. In their evaluation of forgetting 10% of the authors, Maini et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###) demonstrated that gradient ascent and its variants fail to provide a satisfactory balance between forget quality (the difference between the unlearned model and retrained model evaluated on the forget set) and model utility (the general performance on other tasks).\nIn this work, we begin by observing that gradient ascent can often cause a rapid deterioration of model utility during unlearning—a phenomenon we term catastrophic collapse—which we believe is responsible for its unsatisfactory performance. Towards fixing this, we propose a simple yet effective objective function for unlearning termed Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). NPO takes inspiration from preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024  ###reference_b32###; Ouyang et al., 2022  ###reference_b29###; Bai et al., 2022  ###reference_b1###), and can be viewed as its variant that only uses negative samples. Through both theory and experiments, we show that NPO resolves the catastrophic collapse issue associated with gradient ascent, provides more stable training dynamics, and achieves a better trade-off between forget quality and model utility. Coupled with a cross-entropy loss on the retain set, NPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TOFU dataset, and achieves the first non-trivial unlearning result on the challenging task of forgetting 50% of the TOFU data.\nWe outline existing gradient ascent based methods for machine unlearning, and find that these methods suffer from catastrophic collapse (Section 2  ###reference_###). We identify the linear divergence speed of gradient ascent as a main reason for catastrophic collapse.\nWe introduce Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired loss function for LLM unlearning that addresses the catastrophic collapse issue of gradient ascent (GA; Section 3  ###reference_###). We demonstrate that NPO reduces to gradient ascent (GA) in the high-temperature limit. We show in theory the progression towards catastrophic collapse when minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than with GA. See Figure 1  ###reference_### for an illustration of NPO and its connections with existing objectives.\nWe test NPO-based methods on a synthetic binary classification task (Section 4  ###reference_###), where we find that NPO-based methods outperform other baselines by providing a superior Pareto frontier between the Forget Distance and Retain Distance. Furthermore, NPO-based methods exhibit greater learning stability compared to GA-based methods.\nWe evaluate a variety of unlearning methods on the TOFU dataset (Maini et al., 2024  ###reference_b24###) and find that NPO-based methods exhibit superior balance between Forget Quality and Model Utility compared to all baselines (Section 5  ###reference_###). Additionally, NPO-based methods improve the stability of the unlearning process and the readability of the output. Notably, we show that NPO-based methods are the only effective unlearning methods for forgetting 50%-90% of the data, a significant advance over all existing methods which already struggle with forgetting 10% of the data (Section 5.3  ###reference_###).\nThere is a vast literature on machine unlearning and LLM unlearning. Due to limited space, we discuss these related work in Appendix 1.1  ###reference_###."

            "text": "Since its proposal by Cao & Yang (2015  ###reference_b3###), machine unlearning has been extensively studied in the classification literature (Bourtoule et al., 2021  ###reference_b2###; Golatkar et al., 2020  ###reference_b12###; Ginart et al., 2019  ###reference_b11###; Thudi et al., 2022  ###reference_b38###; Izzo et al., 2021  ###reference_b15###; Koh & Liang, 2017  ###reference_b18###; Guo et al., 2019  ###reference_b13###; Sekhari et al., 2021  ###reference_b34###). For reviews of existing works, see Liu et al. (2024a  ###reference_b21###); Zhang et al. (2023  ###reference_b45###); Nguyen et al. (2022  ###reference_b28###); Xu et al. (2023  ###reference_b42###); Si et al. (2023  ###reference_b36###). In particular, Ginart et al. (2019  ###reference_b11###); Guo et al. (2019  ###reference_b13###); Sekhari et al. (2021  ###reference_b34###) introduced theoretical metrics for machine unlearning based on the notion of differential privacy and proposed provably efficient unlearning methods based on Newton update removal mechanisms. However, these algorithms require computing the Hessian of loss functions, which is intractable for LLMs.\nRecent research has explored unlearning methods for LLMs (Jang et al., 2022  ###reference_b16###; Wang et al., 2023  ###reference_b41###; Chen & Yang, 2023  ###reference_b7###; Yao et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023  ###reference_b9###; Yao et al., 2024  ###reference_b43###; Liu et al., 2024b  ###reference_b22###; Li et al., 2024  ###reference_b19###). Notably, the methods proposed in Jang et al. (2022  ###reference_b16###); Yao et al. (2023  ###reference_b44###); Chen & Yang (2023  ###reference_b7###); Maini et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###) are based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of the forget set. In this work, we demonstrate that the NPO approach consistently outperforms GA across various tasks. On the other hand, Eldan & Russinovich (2023  ###reference_b9###) proposed generating positive samples using LLMs and carefully designed prompts, then fine-tuning the model based on the positive samples using a supervised loss. Furthermore, the method of Liu et al. (2024b  ###reference_b22###) is based on knowledge negation, while the approach of Li et al. (2024  ###reference_b19###) relies on controlling model representations. These methods are orthogonal and complementary to the NPO approach.\nOur method, NPO, draws inspiration from the framework of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022  ###reference_b29###; Bai et al., 2022  ###reference_b1###; Stiennon et al., 2020  ###reference_b37###; Rafailov et al., 2024  ###reference_b32###), particularly the Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) method (Rafailov et al., 2024  ###reference_b32###). We note that recent work (Ethayarajh et al., 2024  ###reference_b10###) proposes the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) method for alignment with only non-paired preference data, and a more recent concurrent work (Duan et al., 2024  ###reference_b8###) proposes the Distributional Dispreference Optimization (O) approach for unlearning. Both methods share a similar formulation to NPO. We compare the performance of NPO with KTO in simulations.\nRecent work has proposed several benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics for unlearning methods (Ji et al., 2024  ###reference_b17###; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023  ###reference_b9###; Maini et al., 2024  ###reference_b24###; Li et al., 2024  ###reference_b19###; Lynch et al., 2024  ###reference_b23###). In particular, some studies have utilized the PKUSafe dataset (Ji et al., 2024  ###reference_b17###) for benchmarking unlearning methods. Eldan & Russinovich (2023  ###reference_b9###) crafts a specific task of “forgetting Harry Potter”. Maini et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###) introduces TOFU, a task of fictitious unlearning for LLMs, which is the benchmark we adopted in this paper. Additionally, Li et al. (2024  ###reference_b19###) proposes the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) for measuring hazardous knowledge in LLMs. Lynch et al. (2024  ###reference_b23###) proposes eight methods to evaluate robust unlearning in LLM, which incorporate robust metrics against jailbreak attacks.\nFinally, we note the existence of attack methods for extracting data from unlearned models (Shi et al., 2023  ###reference_b35###; Patil et al., 2023  ###reference_b30###), and other unlearning methods including model editing (Mitchell et al., 2022  ###reference_b27###; Meng et al., 2022  ###reference_b26###) and in-context unlearning (Pawelczyk et al., 2023  ###reference_b31###)."

More precisely, we aim to fine-tune111There are alternative approaches such as prompt engineering (Pawelczyk et al., 2023  ###reference_b31###) for performing unlearning tasks. the model to make it behave like the retrained model , a model trained only on the retain set . In other words, we would like the model to behave as if the samples in the forget set  were never used to train it.\nBy definition, the best approach for machine unlearning, in principle, is to retrain the model from scratch on  only, which is, however, often intractable in practice.\nis a key component in many existing LLM unlearning methods and an important baseline method for LLM unlearning on its own. The idea is simply to perform gradient ascent on the (next-token prediction) loss over the forget set, which can be viewed equivalently as gradient descent on the negative prediction loss, denoted as :\nThe rationale of gradient ascent is that since the initial model  is trained on , a subsequent maximization of prediction loss on the forget set  would approximately “revert” the optimization on the forget set , thus unlearning  and approximating a model trained on  only.\nBuilding on gradient ascent, a large class of unlearning methods perform gradient-based optimization on a linear combination of the GA loss  and several other loss functions that either encourage unlearning or preserve utility (Jang et al., 2022  ###reference_b16###; Yao et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###; Chen & Yang, 2023  ###reference_b7###; Maini et al., 2024  ###reference_b24###; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023  ###reference_b9###). Notable examples include\nForget (FG) loss: , where  and  is any “uninformed” response for prompt  which the unlearned model could aim to output. Examples of such ’s include replacing true information by random (but appearingly sensible) information (which requires hand-crafting such as Eldan & Russinovich (2023  ###reference_b9###)), or simply answering “I don’t know” (Maini et al., 2024  ###reference_b24###).\nRetain (RT) loss: , which encourages the model to still perform well on the retain set ;\n, which measures the distance to the initial model  (in KL divergence) on the forget set;\n, which measures the distance to the initial model  (in KL divergence) on the retain set.\nFor example, Yao et al. (2023  ###reference_b44###) minimize a combination of , and Chen & Yang (2023  ###reference_b7###) minimize a combination of . Maini et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###) find that incorporating the retain loss  usually improves the performance of unlearning.\nUnlearning methods should not only unlearn the forget set, i.e., achieve a high forget quality, but also maintain the model’s performance on the retain set, i.e., maintain the model utility. For example, letting the model simply output “I don’t know” is an unlearning method that achieves good forget quality (in certain sense) but bad model utility. While there is not yet a consensus on the right metrics for forget quality and model utility (and we will present our choices momentarily), a general rule of thumb is that unlearning methods should achieve a good tradeoff between these two goals."

            "text": "###figure_2### We begin by testing gradient ascent as a standalone method (as opposed to combining it with other losses), and find that gradient ascent exhibits a common failure mode dubbed as catastrophic collapse: Along the unlearning process, the model utility quickly drops to zero, and the forget quality improves temporarily for a very short time horizon before quickly dropping too (Figure 2  ###reference_### left/middle-left). Along the same training trajectory, the model diverges quickly from the initial model (as measured by the KL distance to the initial model), after which the model generates gibberish outputs (Figure 2  ###reference_### middle-right/right).\nWe attribute the catastrophic collapse to the divergent nature of the gradient ascent algorithm due to the fact that it maximizes (instead of minimizes) the standard next-token prediction loss. Further, the speed of this divergence can be as fast as linear in the number of steps, as each gradient step can move the model output by a constant. To see this on a toy example, consider a linear-logistic -class classifier given by , . For any “already unlearned” sample  with true label  and model prediction  (so that  does not predict ), standard calculation shows that the gradient of GA loss with respect to  is , which has a constant scale (not diminishing along the unlearning progress) and can cause the model to diverge in a linear speed. Therefore, the divergent dynamics may initially bring the model closer to  but would ultimately send the model to infinity (c.f. Theorem 2  ###reference_orem2###).\nWhile we believe some kind of divergent behavior is necessary and perhaps unavoidable (as the goal of unlearning is to “revert” optimization), the fast divergence speed of gradient ascent is a rather undesired feature and motivates the proposal of our NPO method which diverges at a slower speed."

Besides, we examine DPO and its regularized variants (DPO+RT, DPO+KL), as well as KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024  ###reference_b10###) and its variant (KTO+RT). All experiments on TOFU are conducted on Llama-2-7B-chat (Touvron et al., 2023  ###reference_b39###). See Section E.1  ###reference_### for more details.\nFigure 5  ###reference_### illustrates the trade-off between forget quality and model utility for various unlearning methods in the Forget01, Forget05, and Forget10. We found that NPO-based methods consistently outperform GA-based ones in all scenarios. Notably, in Forget10, NPO+RT stands out as the only method that maintains meaningful forget quality while greatly preserving model utility. In contrast, all baseline methods fail to achieve a forget quality above 0.05.\n###figure_6### ###figure_7### Figure 6  ###reference_### illustrates the evolution of forget quality and model utility along the unlearning process. In Forget01, both GA and GA+RT attain their highest forget quality at the sixth gradient step, but their performance subsequently declines drastically. Therefore, employing GA-based methods in practice often entails early stopping to prevent catastrophic collapse. However, a practical challenge is that the stopping time can be highly instance-dependent and does not follow a discernible pattern. In contrast, NPO-based methods display considerably greater stability, with forget quality consistently reaching and maintaining a plateau.\nLLMs unlearned via GA-based methods tend to output repeated words or gibberish sentences with unreasonably low diversity (Yao et al., 2023  ###reference_b44###). Moreover, IDK and DPO-based methods tend to show excessive ignorance. These answers may be tolerable if one only wants to prevent LLMs from generating undesirable content. Still, they will definitely be unsatisfactory under the stronger goal of approximate unlearning, which aims to mimic the retrained model. We show in Figure 7  ###reference_### that NPO+RT outputs incorrect sentences with similar templates for questions in the forget set while generating fluent and correct answers for other questions, greatly enhancing the fluency and diversity of the generated content.\n###figure_8### To further investigate the role of retain loss beyond Maini et al. (2024  ###reference_b24###), we evaluate NPO+RT with the weights of the retain loss varying from 0 to 5 (Figure 11  ###reference_###). While it is natural that adding retain loss improves the model utility, we are surprised that the forget quality also grows. Specifically, the forget quality increases as the weight of the retain loss grows from 0 to 2. We conjecture that the retain loss term helps the model preserve answer templates and linguistic structures, while the NPO term forces the model to forget some specific facts. Combining these two effects pushes the model to approximate the retrained model by generating outputs with similar templates but incorrect entities. We also note that further increasing the weight of the retain loss (e.g., from 2 to 5) leads to a drop in forget quality.\nHaving demonstrated that NPO-based methods can effectively unlearn 10% of the TOFU data, we now expand our scope to the tasks of forgetting 20%, 30%, and 50% of the TOFU data (referred to as Forget20, Forget30, Forget50, respectively). Details about the extended dataset are deferred to Section E.1.1  ###reference_.SSS1###. We show in Section E.2  ###reference_### that NPO+RT is the sole method to exhibit meaningful forget quality (a p-value above 0.05) in Forget20 and Forget30. Even in Forget50, where the vanilla NPO+RT achieves a forget quality around , it still significantly outperforms other methods.\nThe TOFU framework allows us to aim to forget at most 90% of the data since at least 10% is left out as the retain set for evaluation. We thus ask the question of whether there exist methods that could effectively forget 50%-90% of the TOFU data. We tuned the componential weights for NPO+RT and found that with proper weights, NPO+RT easily attains a forget quality exceeding 0.05 and model utility above 0.55 on Forget50 and Forget90, as reported in Figure 8  ###reference_###."

(2024  ###reference_b24###  ###reference_b24###). Forget quality assesses how well the unlearned model mimics the retrained model (defined as the model trained only on the retain set), while model utility measures the general capacities and the real-world knowledge of the unlearned model. Since the forget quality is defined as the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which tests the similarity between some distributions generated by the unlearned model and the retrained one, we treat a forget quality greater than  as evidence of a meaningful forgetting.

NPO makes steps towards addressing the catastrophic collapse issue in the gradient ascent method. We show that unlearning methods based on NPO objective achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLM unlearning, and achieves the first effective unlearning result on forgetting a high percentage of the training data. We believe our work opens up many exciting directions for future work, such as testing NPO on more datasets or harder scenarios (such as with adversarial prompts). It may also be of interest to generalize the algorithm principle of NPO (preference optimization with negative examples only) to other problems beyond unlearning."
