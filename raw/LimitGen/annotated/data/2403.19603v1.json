            "text": "Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) is a task that involves an agent navigating in a physical environment in response to natural language instructions (Wu et al., 2021  ###reference_b69###).\nThe data annotation for the VLN task is time-consuming and costly to scale up, and\nthe development of models that address the task is severely limited by the availability of training data (Gu et al., 2022  ###reference_b16###).\nNavigation instruction generation (VL-GEN) is the reverse of the VLN task in that it generates natural language instructions for a path in the virtual (or physical) environment, which is helpful for interactions with users and explainability.\nPrevious work has also demonstrated the effectiveness of VL-GEN in improving the performance of VLN systems such as the Speaker-Follower model (Fried et al., 2018  ###reference_b14###) and Env Drop (Tan et al., 2019  ###reference_b57###).\nThis paper explores the VL-GEN task of generating navigation instruction framing it as an image captioning task.\nVL-GEN requires the model to generate language instruction in the context of the physical environment, grounding objects references and action instructions to the given space.\nPrevious studies use photo-realistic RGB panoramic images as the visual input; they frame VL-GEN as the end-to-end task of generating text from a sequence of photo-realistic RGB images (Fried et al., 2018  ###reference_b14###; Tan et al., 2019  ###reference_b57###; Wang et al., 2022d  ###reference_b66###).\nWhile Zhao et al. (2021  ###reference_b75###) report that the overall quality of instructions generated with end-to-end models is only slightly better than that of template-based generation, the application of object grounding to the panoramic images achieves a better result Wang et al. (2022d  ###reference_b66###).\nThe existing approach to this task has two shortcomings.\nFrom the perspective of representation, using panoramic images is resource-intensive as it requires processing of multiple image inputs corresponding to different points on the path.\nSecond, panoramic images contain many details that are irrelevant for the task.\nThe model has to learn to interpret the environments from RGB panoramas, such as object recognition, and generate instructions at the same time.\nAs it is natural for humans to understand navigation instructions from a top-down map (as in Google Maps) Paz-Argaman et al. (2024  ###reference_b47###), we propose to separate the VL-GEN task into two steps: 1) environment interpretation, which is addressed by semantic SLAM in physical robotic systems Chaplot et al. (2020  ###reference_b7###), and 2) spatial reasoning.\nIn this paper, we focus on the second step and explore the feasibility of using top-down semantic map for VL-GEN.\n###figure_1### Our research question is whether it is feasible to use the top-down semantic map (a single RGB image) as our main source of information.\nWe also explore which other data sources, in addition to the semantic map, can further improve performance.\nTo address this question, we formalize the VL-GEN task as image captioning with the input of a semantic map with the path (see Figure 1  ###reference_###).\nWe extract the images of top-down maps from the Habitat simulator (Savva et al., 2019  ###reference_b51###) based on Room-to-Room dataset (Anderson et al., 2018  ###reference_b3###) and VLN-CE (Krantz et al., 2020  ###reference_b32###).\nOur key contributions and findings include the following:\nWe extend the R2R dataset with semantic maps, providing a new benchmark dataset and a baseline that demonstrates the feasibility of using semantic maps for VL-GEN task.\nWe demonstrate experimentally with both automatic and human evaluations that including additional information (namely, region, action, and prompt) leads to more accurate and robust navigation instructions than using only semantic maps.\nWe also conduct an intrinsic human evaluation of the quality of the generated instructions with fine-grained error analysis."

(2022  ###reference_b34###); Wang et al. (2022b  ###reference_b64###), we frame the VL-GEN task as image captioning task.\nGiven a semantic map , the task is to generate a natural language description  that describes the path  shown.\nOur task description replaces the photo-realistic RGB images used previously, with a semantic map.\nThe processing of RGB images is resource-intensive, while our task definition has the advantage of abstracting away from the object recognition task, concentrating on the instruction generation task instead.\nWe also experiment with providing the model with additional features of the navigation path beyond the semantic maps alone, including actions, names of regions, and panoramic images.\nThere is a fixed set of action types (left, right, straight, stop), which are determined heuristically from the path shape at each navigation point.\nFor each navigation point, we use the name of its associated region (e.g., hallway, meeting room).\nWe do not think that panoramic images constitute ideal input to the system,\nbut it is possible that they may provide additional visual information not shown in the map.\nTherefore, we also conduct experiments with panoramic images as part of the input information to the model.\nWe extract semantic maps, region and action information from the Habitat (Savva et al., 2019  ###reference_b51###; Krantz et al., 2020  ###reference_b32###) simulation environment.\nIn a deployed robot, it may be obtained with a semantic SLAM component Chaplot et al. (2020  ###reference_b7###).\nEach object type on the map is represented in a unique color.\nWe adopt the navigation paths and human annotations from the R2R dataset (Anderson et al., 2018  ###reference_b3###).\nPanoramic images in RGB are obtained from the Matterport3D simulator (Chang et al., 2017  ###reference_b6###) at each discrete navigation point.\nAn example of the new dataset derived from R2R, including a semantic map with a path, language instruction, panorama images, actions, and region names, is shown in Figure 1  ###reference_###.\nStatistics about the semantic maps are presented in Table 1  ###reference_###.\nThe data splits we use are inherited from the original R2R dataset.\nThe difference between seen validation set and the unseen validation set in R2R is whether the room environment is included in the train set.111Further details on the dataset are presented in Appendix A.1  ###reference_###."

(2021  ###reference_b48###); Li et al. (2022  ###reference_b34###) and multimodal pre-training in BLIP (Li et al., 2022  ###reference_b34###).\nWe investigate the effectiveness of introducing contrastive training for navigation instruction generation task as an auxiliary loss.\nWe define the positive examples  as pairs of the combined input embedding and the instruction embedding.\nThe negative examples  consist of the pairs of the input embedding and the embedding of a randomly sampled instruction.\nFollowing CLIP (Radford et al., 2021  ###reference_b48###), we multiply the multimodal input matrix  and textual instruction matrix  to obtain the predicted compatible matrix  between inputs and labels and then compute the CrossEntropy loss on  with the ground-truth correspondence .\nThe prompting of LLMs has demonstrated its effectiveness across various domains in previous works (Li and Liang, 2021  ###reference_b36###; Liu et al., 2021  ###reference_b41###; Tang et al., 2022  ###reference_b59###; Keicher et al., 2022  ###reference_b28###; Song et al., 2022  ###reference_b54###).\nWe generate the prompt from a template, which describes the nearby objects and regions, such as Starting from the dark yellow point near sofa cushion in the living room region.\nWe tune the model with prompting and feed the prompt template to the decoder during inference.\nWe argue that prompting can benefit the generation task in two ways.\nFirst, it can help visual-language grounding because the prompting template describes nearby landmarks and regions.\nSecond, at inference time, the instructions that are generated are conditioned on the prompt template in an auto-regressive way, resulting in more controllable generation in VL-GEN task."

Fried et al. (2018  ###reference_b14###) (17.0/18.7) and EnvDrop Tan et al.
